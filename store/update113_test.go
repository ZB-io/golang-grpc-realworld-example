**Scenario 1: Successful User Update**

Details:
Description: This test checks that the `Update` function correctly updates the user's data in the database.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User instance with pre-populated data and initialize a `UserStore` instance with a mock DB connection.
  Act: Call the `Update` function on the `UserStore` instance, passing in the User instance.
  Assert: Verify that the function returned no error and that mock DB connection's `Update` function was called with the appropriate user's data.

Validation: 
This test ensures that the function correctly performs an update operation on the given user data. If the function works as expected, this will help maintain user data integrity in the application.

**Scenario 2: Failed User Update due to Database Error**

Details:
Description: This test checks that the `Update` function appropriately returns an error when there is a database-level problem while updating the user.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User instance and initialize a `UserStore` instance with a mock DB connection that causes an error.
  Act: Call the `Update` function on the `UserStore` instance, passing in the User instance.
  Assert: Verify that the function returned the expected error.

Validation: 
This test ensures that the function correctly handles any database-level errors and propagates them up to the caller. This propagating of errors is essential for the caller to handle these scenarios and is a good practice for any database operations.

**Scenario 3: Update when no User Details are provided**

Details:
Description: This test checks that the `Update` function returns an error when no user details are supplied.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `UserStore` instance with a mock DB connection.
  Act: Call the `Update` function on the `UserStore` instance with a nil User instance.
  Assert: Verify that the function returned an error indicating no user details were provided.

Validation: 
This test helps prevent application crashes, as updating a user without any details can lead to null reference issues. This test ensures that the function handles such scenarios correctly.

**Scenario 4: Update when user has invalid fields**

Details:
Description: This test checks that the `Update` function returns an error when invalid user details are provided.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User instance with invalid data (such as an empty username or password) and initialize a `UserStore` instance with a mock DB connection.
  Act: Call the `Update` function on the `UserStore` instance, passing in the User instance.
  Assert: Verify that the function returned an error indicating invalid user details were provided.

Validation:
This test ensures that the function correctly validates the user's data before making an update. The validation prevents potentially corrupted user data from entering the system.
