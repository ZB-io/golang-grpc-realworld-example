Scenario 1: Successful Following of a User

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the Follow function successfully adds a user to another user's Follows array. The target scenario is a normal operation where all provided parameters are valid and the function operates as expected.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create two mock users, 'a' and 'b', with valid properties. Ensure that user 'a' does not already follow user 'b'.
    Act: Invoke the Follow function with users 'a' and 'b' as parameters.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that user 'b' is added to the Follows array of user 'a'.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is to ensure that the Follow function operates as expected in normal conditions. The logic behind the expected result is that a user should be able to follow another user successfully. This test is important as it validates the core functionality of the Follow function.

Scenario 2: Following an Already Followed User

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the Follow function handles the scenario where a user is trying to follow another user they already follow. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Create two mock users, 'a' and 'b', with valid properties. Ensure that user 'a' already follows user 'b'.
    Act: Invoke the Follow function with users 'a' and 'b' as parameters.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that an error is returned or user 'b' is not added twice to the Follows array of user 'a'.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is to ensure that the Follow function handles edge cases correctly. The logic behind the expected result is that a user should not be able to follow another user they already follow. This test is important as it ensures the Follow function correctly handles edge cases.

Scenario 3: Following a Non-Existent User

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the Follow function handles the scenario where a user is trying to follow a non-existent user. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock user 'a' with valid properties and a user 'b' that does not exist in the database.
    Act: Invoke the Follow function with users 'a' and 'b' as parameters.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that an error is returned.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is to ensure that the Follow function handles error scenarios correctly. The logic behind the expected result is that an error should be returned when trying to follow a non-existent user. This test is important as it ensures the Follow function correctly handles error scenarios.
  
Scenario 4: User Following Themselves

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the Follow function handles the scenario where a user tries to follow themselves. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock user 'a' with valid properties.
    Act: Invoke the Follow function with user 'a' as both parameters.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that an error is returned.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is to ensure that the Follow function handles edge cases correctly. The logic behind the expected result is that an error should be returned when a user tries to follow themselves. This test is important as it ensures the Follow function correctly handles edge cases.
