Scenario 1: Normal operation with a valid DB instance
  Details:
    Description: This scenario validates that NewArticleStore returns a valid ArticleStore instance, given a functioning db object. This check ensures that the store is correctly initialized, facilitating future operations.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A mock *gorm.DB object will be created and provided as input.
    Act: The NewArticleStore function is invoked with the mock DB object.
    Assert: Confirm that the ArticleStore is successfully created and that its DB field matches the input provided.
  Validation:
    The given assertion ensures that our store module is correctly setting up its dependencies. A failure here could indicate a critical flaw in the application's ability to interact with the database, severely impeding data registration and retrieval.

Scenario 2: Null database object handling
  Details:
    Description: The test checks for edge case where the NewArticleStore function is invoked with a null database reference.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A nil value is passed as the DB reference.
    Act: The NewArticleStore function is invoked with the null reference.
    Assert: Assert that the ArticleStore instance returned has a nil 'db' attribute.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that our function handles null inputs gracefully, a crucial consideration for avoiding crashes or unexpected behavior. If our function doesn't handle null inputs properly, we might face nil pointer dereferences that would lead to crashes.

Scenario 3: New database object between successive calls
  Details:
    Description: This scenario checks that the NewArticleStore function returns a different ArticleStore instance when called successively with different DB instances.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Two different mock *gorm.DB objects are created.
    Act: The NewArticleStore function is invoked in sequence with the two different DB objects.
    Assert: Confirm that the two ArticleStore instances returned are different and that their 'db' attributes each match the relevant input.
  Validation:
    By asserting different ArticleStore instances for different DB objects, we ensure that our function isn't statically caching previous results, allowing us to manage different stores simultaneously. If the function were persisting the first result, it could lead to data corruption, wherein operations meant for one store (database connection) could affect another.
