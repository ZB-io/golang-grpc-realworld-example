FUNCTION_DEF=func (s *ArticleStore) GetComments(m *model.Article) ([]model.Comment, error)
Here are several test scenarios for the GetComments function:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully retrieve comments for an article

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the GetComments function correctly retrieves all comments associated with a given article, including the author information for each comment.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a test database and populate it with a sample article and multiple comments.
    - Ensure the comments have different authors.
    - Create an ArticleStore instance with the test database.
  Act:
    - Call GetComments with the sample article.
  Assert:
    - Verify that the returned slice of comments matches the expected number of comments.
    - Check that each comment's ArticleID matches the input article's ID.
    - Ensure that the Author field is populated for each comment.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the core functionality of retrieving comments works as expected. It validates that the Preload("Author") is working correctly and that the WHERE clause is filtering comments properly.

Scenario 2: Retrieve comments for an article with no comments

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of GetComments when called for an article that has no associated comments.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a test database with a sample article but no comments.
    - Create an ArticleStore instance with the test database.
  Act:
    - Call GetComments with the sample article.
  Assert:
    - Verify that the returned slice of comments is empty.
    - Ensure that no error is returned.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function handles the edge case of an article with no comments gracefully, returning an empty slice rather than an error.

Scenario 3: Handle database error when retrieving comments

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the GetComments function properly handles and returns any database errors that occur during the query execution.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock database that returns an error when the Find method is called.
    - Create an ArticleStore instance with the mock database.
  Act:
    - Call GetComments with any valid article model.
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error.
    - Ensure that the returned slice of comments is empty.
Validation:
  This test is critical for error handling. It ensures that database errors are not silently ignored and are properly propagated to the caller, allowing for appropriate error handling at higher levels of the application.

Scenario 4: Retrieve comments for a non-existent article

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of GetComments when called with an article ID that doesn't exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a test database with some articles and comments.
    - Create an ArticleStore instance with the test database.
    - Create a model.Article instance with an ID that doesn't exist in the database.
  Act:
    - Call GetComments with the non-existent article.
  Assert:
    - Verify that the returned slice of comments is empty.
    - Ensure that no error is returned.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function behaves correctly when querying for comments on an article that doesn't exist, returning an empty slice rather than an error.

Scenario 5: Verify correct ordering of retrieved comments

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the comments are retrieved in the correct order (assuming a default order by creation time).
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a test database with an article and multiple comments created at different times.
    - Create an ArticleStore instance with the test database.
  Act:
    - Call GetComments with the article.
  Assert:
    - Verify that the returned slice of comments is in the correct order (e.g., newest first or oldest first, depending on the expected behavior).
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the comments are consistently retrieved in the expected order, which is crucial for displaying them correctly in the user interface.

Scenario 6: Verify performance with a large number of comments

Details:
  Description: This test checks the performance of GetComments when dealing with an article that has a large number of comments.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a test database with an article and a very large number of comments (e.g., 10,000).
    - Create an ArticleStore instance with the test database.
  Act:
    - Call GetComments with the article, measuring the execution time.
  Assert:
    - Verify that all comments are retrieved correctly.
    - Ensure that the execution time is within acceptable limits.
Validation:
  This test is important to identify any performance issues that might arise when dealing with articles that have a large number of comments, ensuring that the function remains efficient at scale.
```

These test scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling for the GetComments function. They aim to ensure the function works correctly under various conditions and handles different scenarios appropriately.
