Scenario 1: Successful Article Update

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the Update function can successfully update the details of an article in the database.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database and an instance of ArticleStore. Also, create an instance of model.Article with specific details that need to be updated.
  Act: Invoke the Update function on the ArticleStore instance with the model.Article instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes, i.e., the function returns no error and the updated details of the article are reflected in the mock database.

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function, which is to update the article's details without returning an error. This test is crucial to ensure that the application can accurately update article details as per the user's requirements.

Scenario 2: Article Update with Non-Existing Article

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the Update function when it is invoked with an article that does not exist in the database.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database and an instance of ArticleStore. Also, create an instance of model.Article with details that do not match any existing article in the database.
  Act: Invoke the Update function on the ArticleStore instance with the model.Article instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error indicating that the article does not exist.

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when the article to be updated does not exist. This test is important to ensure that the application correctly handles situations where non-existing articles are to be updated.

Scenario 3: Article Update with Invalid Article Details

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Update function when it is invoked with an article having invalid details.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database and an instance of ArticleStore. Also, create an instance of model.Article with invalid details (e.g., empty title, description, or body).
  Act: Invoke the Update function on the ArticleStore instance with the model.Article instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error indicating that the article details are invalid.

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's expected behavior when the article details are invalid. This test is crucial to ensure that the application correctly validates the article details before updating them in the database.

Scenario 4: Article Update with Database Error

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the Update function when a database error occurs during the update operation.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database that returns an error when an update operation is performed, and an instance of ArticleStore. Also, create an instance of model.Article with valid details.
  Act: Invoke the Update function on the ArticleStore instance with the model.Article instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns the same error as the one returned by the database.

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's expected behavior when it encounters a database error. This test is crucial to ensure that the application correctly handles database errors and propagates them to the calling function.
