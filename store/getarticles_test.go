Scenario 1: Get Articles by Username

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the fetch functionality of articles by a specific username. The target scenario is when the username is provided and it exists in the database.

Execution:
Arrange: Create mock data of articles with different users. Make sure some articles are associated with the target username.
Act: Invoke the GetArticles function with the target username and other parameters as default or null.
Assert: Assert that the returned articles are only those associated with the target username.

Validation:
The assertion is based on the function's expected behavior to filter articles by username. This test is important to validate that the function correctly fetches articles for a specific user.

Scenario 2: Get Articles by Tag Name

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the fetch functionality of articles by a specific tag name. The target scenario is when the tag name is provided and it exists in the database.

Execution:
Arrange: Create mock data of articles with different tags. Make sure some articles are associated with the target tag.
Act: Invoke the GetArticles function with the target tag and other parameters as default or null.
Assert: Assert that the returned articles are only those associated with the target tag.

Validation:
The assertion is based on the function's expected behavior to filter articles by tag. This test is important to validate that the function correctly fetches articles for a specific tag.

Scenario 3: Get Articles favorited by a User

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the fetch functionality of articles favorited by a specific user. The target scenario is when the user model is provided and it exists in the database.

Execution:
Arrange: Create mock data of articles with different users favoriting them. Make sure some articles are favorited by the target user.
Act: Invoke the GetArticles function with the target user and other parameters as default or null.
Assert: Assert that the returned articles are only those favorited by the target user.

Validation:
The assertion is based on the function's expected behavior to filter articles favorited by a specific user. This test is important to validate that the function correctly fetches articles favorited by a specific user.

Scenario 4: Get Articles with Invalid Username

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the error handling of the function when an invalid username is provided.

Execution:
Arrange: Create mock data of articles with different users.
Act: Invoke the GetArticles function with an invalid username and other parameters as default or null.
Assert: Assert that the returned error is not null.

Validation:
The assertion is based on the function's expected behavior to return an error when the username does not exist in the database. This test is important to validate that the function correctly handles error scenarios.

Scenario 5: Get Articles with Invalid Tag Name

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the error handling of the function when an invalid tag name is provided.

Execution:
Arrange: Create mock data of articles with different tags.
Act: Invoke the GetArticles function with an invalid tag name and other parameters as default or null.
Assert: Assert that the returned error is not null.

Validation:
The assertion is based on the function's expected behavior to return an error when the tag name does not exist in the database. This test is important to validate that the function correctly handles error scenarios.
