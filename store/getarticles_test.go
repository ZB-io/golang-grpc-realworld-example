ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=GetArticles_1a0b3b0e8b

Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of articles given a tag name

Details:
  Description: The test verifies the function's ability to successfully retrieve articles using a specific tag name, providing an empty username and nil favoritedBy.
Execution:
  Arrange: Seed the database with dummy articles, tags, and their relationships, ensuring at least some have the matching tag name.
  Act: Invoke GetArticles with the targeted tag name, empty string for username, nil for favoritedBy, and arbitrary limit and offset.
  Assert: Ensure the returned slice of articles is not empty and contains only articles with the targeted tag.
Validation:
  The assertion validates as expected. If there are articles with the provided tag name, they all should be returned. This test ensures the expected functionality of retrieving articles by tag.
  
Scenario 2: Successful retrieval of articles by user's username

Details: 
  Description: The test verifies that the function can retrieve articles by a specific username, supplying an empty tag, and nil favoritedBy.
Execution:
  Arrange: Seed the database with dummy articles and their relationships with users, ensuring some articles are authored by a user with the targeted username.
  Act: Invoke GetArticles with an empty string for tag, the targeted username, nil for favoritedBy, and arbitrary limit and offset.
  Assert: Ensure the returned slice of articles is not empty and contains only articles authored by the user with the targeted username.
Validation: 
  The assertion is based on expected behaviour. If there are articles authored by the provided username, they all should be returned. This test ensures the expected functionality of retrieving articles by author.

Scenario 3: Successful retrieval of articles favorited by a specific user

Details: 
  Description: The test verifies that the function can retrieve articles favorited by a particular user, supplying an empty tag, username and favoritedBy.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create dummy users and articles in the database, and favorited relations between them, ensuring some articles are favorited by the targeted user.
  Act: Invoke GetArticles with an empty string for tag and username, the targeted user in the favoritedBy parameter, and arbitrary limit and offset.
  Assert: Check that the returned slice of articles is not empty and contains only articles favorited by the targeted user.
Validation: 
  The assertion makes sense because if there are articles favorited by the provided user, they should all be returned. This test ensures that the function correctly retrieves articles favored by a specific user.
  
Scenario 4: Handling of non-existent parameters

Details: 
  Description: The test verifies that the function can handle non-existent parameters such as non-existing tag names or usernames.
Execution:
  Arrange: Seed the database with dummy data.
  Act: Invoke GetArticles with non-existent tag name, username, and nil favoritedBy.
  Assert: Ensure the returned slice of articles is empty and no error is returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates based on the expectation that if no articles match the provided parameters, an empty slice should be returned, and no errors should be thrown. This test verifies the robustness of the function in handling non-existent parameters.
  
Scenario 5: Proper handling of pagination via limit and offset

Details: 
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles pagination via the limit and offset parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Seed the database with a known amount of dummy articles, tags, and their relationships.
  Act: Invoke GetArticles with the same tag name, empty username, nil favoritedBy, and different limits and offsets.
  Assert: Ensure the returned slice of articles matches each limit (if enough articles remain) and is correctly offset.
Validation: 
  Asserting on the length of the returned slice and the contents assures that pagination works as expected. This is important because correct paging is often critical for performance and usability.
