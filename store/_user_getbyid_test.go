FUNCTION_DEF=func (s *UserStore) GetByID(id uint) (*model.User, error)
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `GetByID` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully retrieve an existing user

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the GetByID function can successfully retrieve a user when given a valid ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a known user record.
  Act: Call GetByID with the ID of the known user.
  Assert: Verify that the returned user matches the expected user data and that no error is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures the basic functionality of retrieving a user by ID works correctly. It's crucial for user-related operations in the application.

Scenario 2: Attempt to retrieve a non-existent user

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of GetByID when given an ID that doesn't exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database without any user records or with known IDs.
  Act: Call GetByID with an ID that doesn't exist in the database.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and a non-nil error (likely a "record not found" error).
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure proper error handling when querying for non-existent users, preventing nil pointer dereferences in the application.

Scenario 3: Handle database connection error

Details:
  Description: This test simulates a database connection error to check how GetByID handles it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that returns a connection error when queried.
  Act: Call GetByID with any valid uint ID.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and a non-nil error that reflects the database connection issue.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function properly handles and reports database-level errors, which is crucial for diagnosing issues in production.

Scenario 4: Retrieve user with ID 0 (edge case)

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of GetByID when given an ID of 0, which is often an edge case in database systems.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that may or may not contain a user with ID 0.
  Act: Call GetByID with ID 0.
  Assert: Verify the function's behavior - it should either return an error (if 0 is invalid) or the correct user if one exists with ID 0.
Validation:
  This test covers an important edge case that could reveal unexpected behavior in the database or ORM layer.

Scenario 5: Retrieve user with maximum uint value (edge case)

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of GetByID when given the maximum possible uint value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that doesn't contain a user with the maximum uint ID.
  Act: Call GetByID with math.MaxUint32 or math.MaxUint64 (depending on the system's uint size).
  Assert: Verify that the function handles this extreme value gracefully, likely returning a "not found" error.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle extreme ID values without panicking or causing overflow issues.

Scenario 6: Verify all user fields are correctly populated

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that all fields of the User struct are correctly retrieved and populated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a user record containing non-null values for all fields.
  Act: Call GetByID with the ID of this fully populated user.
  Assert: Verify that all fields in the returned user struct match the expected values from the database.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the ORM mapping is correct and all user data is being properly retrieved and mapped.

Scenario 7: Handle partial user data (some null fields)

Details:
  Description: This test checks how GetByID handles a user record with some null or empty fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a user record that has some null or empty fields.
  Act: Call GetByID with the ID of this partially populated user.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the user with correct values for populated fields and appropriate zero values for null fields.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles and represents partially populated user records, which is common in real-world databases.
```

These scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the `GetByID` function. They take into account the function's signature, the `UserStore` struct, and the `model.User` struct definition provided in the context.
