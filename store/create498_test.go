Scenario 1: Successful User Creation

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the Create function can successfully create a new user in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock of the *gorm.DB type and a new instance of User with valid data. The mock should mimic successful user creation in the database.
  Act: Invoke the Create function with the new user instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result (error) is nil.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to confirm that the function executes correctly without returning an error. The successful creation of a new user is crucial for user registration in the application.

Scenario 2: User Creation with Existing Email

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Create function handles the scenario where a user attempts to register with an email that already exists in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock of the *gorm.DB type and a new instance of User with an email that already exists in the database. The mock should mimic the scenario of attempting to create a user with a duplicate email.
  Act: Invoke the Create function with the new user instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result (error) is not nil.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to confirm that the function returns an error when a user attempts to register with an existing email. This test is important as it prevents duplicate user registration with the same email.

Scenario 3: User Creation with Existing Username

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Create function handles the scenario where a user attempts to register with a username that already exists in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock of the *gorm.DB type and a new instance of User with a username that already exists in the database. The mock should mimic the scenario of attempting to create a user with a duplicate username.
  Act: Invoke the Create function with the new user instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result (error) is not nil.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to confirm that the function returns an error when a user attempts to register with an existing username. This test is important as it ensures unique usernames for every user in the application.

Scenario 4: User Creation with Invalid Data

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Create function handles the scenario where a user attempts to register with invalid data (e.g., empty email or username).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock of the *gorm.DB type and a new instance of User with invalid data. The mock should mimic the scenario of attempting to create a user with invalid data.
  Act: Invoke the Create function with the new user instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result (error) is not nil.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to confirm that the function returns an error when a user attempts to register with invalid data. This test is important as it ensures that only valid data is stored in the database.
