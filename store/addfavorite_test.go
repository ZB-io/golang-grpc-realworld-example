Scenario 1: Successful Addition of a Favorite Article

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the AddFavorite function, where the user and article passed to the function are valid and the user is successfully added to the article's FavoritedUsers list.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the DB and create a user and an article with valid data. 
  Act: Invoke AddFavorite function with the created user and article.
  Assert: Check if the user was successfully added to the FavoritedUsers list of the article and the article's FavoritesCount was incremented by one.

Validation:
  We assert the successful addition of the user to the FavoritedUsers list and the increment of FavoritesCount to ensure that the function operates as expected under normal conditions. This test is crucial as it checks the core functionality of the AddFavorite function.

Scenario 2: Rollback on Failure to Add User to FavoritedUsers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when there's an error in adding the user to the FavoritedUsers list, which should trigger a rollback.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the DB and create a user and an article with valid data. Simulate an error in the Association function.
  Act: Invoke AddFavorite function with the created user and article.
  Assert: Check if the transaction was rolled back and no changes were made to the article's FavoritedUsers list and FavoritesCount.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the transaction was rolled back correctly when an error occurs during the process. This test ensures the function's robustness and correctness by verifying its error handling and rollback mechanism.

Scenario 3: Rollback on Failure to Update FavoritesCount

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when there's an error in updating the FavoritesCount, which should trigger a rollback.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the DB and create a user and an article with valid data. Simulate an error in the Update function.
  Act: Invoke AddFavorite function with the created user and article.
  Assert: Check if the transaction was rolled back and no changes were made to the article's FavoritedUsers list and FavoritesCount.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the transaction was rolled back correctly when an error occurs during the FavoritesCount update. This test ensures the function's robustness and correctness by verifying its error handling and rollback mechanism.
