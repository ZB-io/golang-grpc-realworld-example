Scenario 1: Both user parameters are nil

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the function behavior when null values are inputted for both user parameters. The function should return false and no error.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set both user parameters to nil.
  Act: Call the function using the arranged nil parameters.
  Assert: Check that the boolean return value is false and the error is nil

Validation:
  The boolean return value is asserted to be false because both input parameters are nil.
  Verifying that this behavior is properly handled is important because null values could occur due to missing data or errors. 
  This test could prevent unexpected errors due to unhandled null values.

Scenario 2: The first user parameter is nil 

Details:
  Description: This test checks for the function's behavior when only the first user parameter is nil. The function should return false without any error.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set the first user parameter to nil and assign a valid value to the second user parameter.
  Act: Invoke the function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Validate that the function returns false and without any error.

Validation:
  The test expects a false return because the first parameter is nil. It highlights the importance of handling scenarios where some but not all data may be missing or erroneous.

Scenario 3: The second user parameter is nil

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function behavior when the second user parameter is nil. The function should return false and no error.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set the first user parameter to a valid value and the second user parameter to nil.
  Act: Call the function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Validate that the function returns false and no error.

Validation:
  The function is expected to return false because the second parameter is nil. This test is significant in handling cases where some of the data might be missing or erroneous but not all.

Scenario 4: User A is following User B

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests the regular operation of the function when user A is following user B.

Execution: 
  Arrange: Set up a scenario where user A is following user B in the database.
  Act: Call the function with user A and user B as inputs.
  Assert: Check that the return value is true and no error is returned.

Validation: 
  The function is expected to return true because according to the arrangement user A is following User B. This test validates that the function operates correctly under normal conditions.

Scenario 5: User A is not following User B
  
Details:
  Description: This test checks the function operation if user A is not following user B.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a scenario where user A is not following user B in the database.
  Act: Invoke the function with user A and user B.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false and without any error.

Validation:
  The function is supposed to return false since user A is not following user B according to the arrangement.
  This test validates that the function correctly identifies when a user isn't following another.

Scenario 6: Database connection error

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests the function's behavior when a database error occurs.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a database error.
  Act: Call the function with valid user A and user B inputs.
  Assert: Assert that an error is returned.

Validation:
  The function is expected to return an error due to the database error mock. This test is crucial in verifying that the function correctly handles database errors and doesn't cause unhandled exceptions or data corruption.
