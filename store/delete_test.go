Scenario 1: Successful Deletion of an Article

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function successfully deletes an article from the database. The target scenario is when a valid article is provided to the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database and an instance of ArticleStore. Also, create and save a mock Article in the database.
  Act: Invoke the Delete function with the mock Article as an argument.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to assert that the returned error is nil and the article is no longer present in the database.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's expected behavior when provided with a valid article. If the function operates correctly, it should not return an error, and the article should no longer exist in the database. This test is important as it verifies the function's basic functionality.

Scenario 2: Deletion of a Non-Existent Article

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the function behaves when asked to delete an article that does not exist in the database. The target scenario is when an invalid or non-existent article is provided to the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database and an instance of ArticleStore. Also, create a mock Article but do not save it in the database.
  Act: Invoke the Delete function with the mock Article as an argument.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to assert that the returned error is not nil.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's expected behavior when provided with a non-existent article. The function should return an error, indicating that the deletion was unsuccessful. This test is important as it tests the function's error handling capabilities.

Scenario 3: Deletion of an Article with Associated Data

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function successfully deletes an article and its associated data (such as tags and comments) from the database. The target scenario is when an article with associated data is provided to the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database and an instance of ArticleStore. Also, create and save a mock Article with associated Tags and Comments in the database.
  Act: Invoke the Delete function with the mock Article as an argument.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to assert that the returned error is nil, and the article and its associated data are no longer present in the database.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the function's expected behavior when provided with an article with associated data. If the function operates correctly, it should not return an error, and the article along with its associated data should no longer exist in the database. This test is crucial as it verifies the function's ability to handle complex deletions.
