Scenario 1: Delete an existing article
Details:
    Description: This test will check if the function is able to correctly delete an existing article from the database.
Execution:
    Arrange: An existing article must be present in the database, which will be removed.
    Act: Call the Delete function on the previously existing article.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the article has been removed from the database.
Validation: 
    The assertion checks whether the function correctly deletes an article. If the article can't be found in the database after the function call, we can conclude that the deletion was successful. This is an important function as part of the CRUD operations that the application needs to handle.

Scenario 2: Delete an article that does not exist
Details:
    Description: This test will check whether the function correctly handles attempts to delete an article that does not exist in the database.
Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure that there is no article in the database with the given ID.
    Act: Call the Delete function on the non-existing article.
    Assert: Expect the Delete function to return an error.
Validation:
    The assertion validates if the function returns an error when trying to delete a non-existing article. This is important to ensure the function does not silently fail or panic when receiving an invalid input.

Scenario 3: Delete a null article
Details:
    Description: This test will check whether the function correctly handles attempts to delete a null article.
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a null article, without any data.
    Act: Call the Delete function on the null article.
    Assert: Expect the Delete function to return an error.
Validation:
    The assertion validates if the function returns an error when trying to delete a null article. This is important as part of error handling in the application. The function should be able to recognize invalid or inappropriate data and respond accordingly.

Scenario 4: Ensure the function deletes the correct article
Details:
    Description: This test will check if the function deletes the correct article when multiple articles exist.
Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure that there are multiple articles in the database.
    Act: Call the Delete function on one of them.
    Assert: Validate that only the intended article has been deleted and others remain unaffected.
Validation:
    The assertion checks whether the function correctly deletes only the specified article, without affecting other data. This is crucial to prevent data loss in the application.

Scenario 5: Check database's state after deleting all Articles
Details:
    Description: This test will check if the database's state is consistent after deleting all articles.
Execution:
    Arrange: Make sure there are several articles present in the database.
    Act: Call the Delete function repeatedly until no articles are left.
    Assert: Database count should be zero.
Validation:
    Assertion validates that the function and the database operate correctly when all records are deleted. It ensures that no stale or ghost entries are left in the database.
