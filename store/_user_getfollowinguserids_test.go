FUNCTION_DEF=func (s *UserStore) GetFollowingUserIDs(m *model.User) ([]uint, error)
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `GetFollowingUserIDs` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of following user IDs

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly retrieves the IDs of users that the given user is following when there are multiple followers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test database with a user who is following multiple other users.
  Act: Call GetFollowingUserIDs with the test user.
  Assert: Verify that the returned slice of uint contains the expected user IDs and that no error is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures the core functionality of the function works as expected under normal conditions. It's crucial for validating the basic operation of the follow system in the application.

Scenario 2: User with no followers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when a user is not following anyone.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test database with a user who is not following any other users.
  Act: Call GetFollowingUserIDs with the test user.
  Assert: Verify that an empty slice is returned and no error is produced.
Validation:
  This test covers an edge case and ensures the function handles it gracefully without errors. It's important for preventing potential nil pointer dereferences or incorrect assumptions about the result always containing data.

Scenario 3: Database error handling

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function properly handles and returns database errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that returns an error when the query is executed.
  Act: Call GetFollowingUserIDs with any user.
  Assert: Check that the function returns an empty slice and the expected error.
Validation:
  Error handling is crucial for robust applications. This test ensures that database errors are not silently ignored and are properly propagated to the caller.

Scenario 4: Large number of followers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's performance and correctness when a user is following a large number of other users.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test database with a user following a large number (e.g., 10,000) of other users.
  Act: Call GetFollowingUserIDs with the test user.
  Assert: Verify that all expected IDs are returned without error and within an acceptable time frame.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle scale and performs efficiently with large datasets. It's important for understanding the function's limitations and potential optimization needs.

Scenario 5: Null values in database

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when encountering null values in the to_user_id column.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test database with some null values in the to_user_id column for the test user's follows.
  Act: Call GetFollowingUserIDs with the test user.
  Assert: Verify that null values are properly handled (either skipped or returned as 0) and no error is produced.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function is robust against unexpected data in the database. It's important for preventing potential panics or incorrect data processing.

Scenario 6: User not found in database

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when given a user that doesn't exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test database without the user that will be passed to the function.
  Act: Call GetFollowingUserIDs with a non-existent user.
  Assert: Verify that an empty slice is returned and no error is produced.
Validation:
  This test covers an edge case where the input might be invalid. It ensures the function gracefully handles this situation without causing errors or returning incorrect data.

Scenario 7: Concurrent access

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function behaves correctly under concurrent access from multiple goroutines.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test database with multiple users and their followers.
  Act: Call GetFollowingUserIDs concurrently from multiple goroutines with different users.
  Assert: Verify that all calls return correct results without errors or data races.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function is thread-safe and can be used in concurrent scenarios without issues. It's important for applications that might use this function in parallel processing scenarios.
```

These test scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the `GetFollowingUserIDs` function. They take into account the function's interaction with the database, potential data inconsistencies, and various usage patterns.
