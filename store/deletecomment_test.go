ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=DeleteComment_732762ff12

Scenario 1: Successful Deletion of a Comment

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the "DeleteComment" function can successfully delete a comment from the database. The target scenario is the normal operation where a valid comment is provided.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a mock database and an instance of "ArticleStore". Create and save a comment in the mock database.
  Act: Invoke the "DeleteComment" function with the saved comment as the parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check if the comment has been removed from the mock database.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the comment no longer exists in the database. The expected result is that the comment should be removed from the database after the function is invoked. This test is crucial to ensure that the function is able to perform its primary task - deleting a comment.

Scenario 2: Deletion of a Non-Existing Comment

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the "DeleteComment" function handles the scenario where the provided comment does not exist in the database. The target scenario is the edge case where a non-existing comment is provided.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a mock database and an instance of "ArticleStore". Create a comment but do not save it in the mock database.
  Act: Invoke the "DeleteComment" function with the unsaved comment as the parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check if an error is returned.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if an error is returned. The expected result is that the function should return an error since the comment does not exist in the database. This test is vital to ensure that the function handles edge cases properly.

Scenario 3: Deletion of a Comment with a Null Database Connection

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the "DeleteComment" function handles the scenario where the database connection is null. The target scenario is the error handling where a null database connection is provided.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of "ArticleStore" with a null database connection. Create a comment.
  Act: Invoke the "DeleteComment" function with the created comment as the parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check if an error is returned.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if an error is returned. The expected result is that the function should return an error since the database connection is null. This test is essential to ensure that the function handles error scenarios properly.
