Scenario 1: Successful Retrieval of Tags from Database

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check the successful retrieval of tags from the database. The target scenario is when the database correctly returns the tags.

Execution:
  Arrange: The test should arrange a mock database containing predefined tags that the function will return.
  Act: The function `GetTags` is invoked on an `ArticleStore` instance associated with the mock database.
  Assert: The test should utilize Go testing facilities to check that the tags returned by the function match those predefined in the mock database. It should also check that the function does not return an error.

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is governed by the requirement that the function successfully retrieves the tags from the database. If the database and the function operate correctly, the tags returned should match those previously stored in the database. This test is crucial as it verifies the application's ability to retrieve tags.

Scenario 2: Database Failure Causing Error

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check the function's behavior when a database error occurs. The target scenario is when the database fails to return the tags, causing an error.

Execution:
  Arrange: The test should set up a mock database that returns an error when the `Find` method is invoked.
  Act: The function `GetTags` is invoked on an `ArticleStore` instance associated with the problematic mock database.
  Assert: The test should check that the function's return error is not nil and corresponds to the error returned by the problematic database.

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on how the function should react to a database error - by returning the same error. This test is essential as it explores the function's error-handling mechanism. It ensures that the function correctly communicates any database problems to its users.

Scenario 3: Database Returns No Tags 

Details:
  Description: This test is to check the function's behavior when the database has no tags. The target scenario is where the application's database table for tags is empty. 

Execution: 
  Arrange: The test should arrange a mock database with no tags. 
  Act: The function `GetTags` is invoked on an `ArticleStore` instance associated with the mock database.
  Assert: The test should check if the returned slice of tags is empty and that no error was returned.

Validation:
  The assertion ensures the function handles situations when the database has no tags. As an empty list of tags is technically a valid response, checking for this validates if the function handles edge cases correctly. This test is important in understanding the function's behavior under different possible scenarios, validating the function's versatility and robustness.
