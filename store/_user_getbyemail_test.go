FUNCTION_DEF=func (s *UserStore) GetByEmail(email string) (*model.User, error)
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `GetByEmail` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully retrieve a user by email

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function can correctly retrieve a user from the database when given a valid email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a known user record.
  Act: Call GetByEmail with the email of the known user.
  Assert: Verify that the returned user matches the expected user data and that no error is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures the basic functionality of the method works as expected under normal conditions. It's crucial for validating that user lookups, which are likely a common operation, function correctly.

Scenario 2: Attempt to retrieve a non-existent user

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when querying for an email that doesn't exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database without any user records or with known user records that don't match the test email.
  Act: Call GetByEmail with an email that doesn't exist in the database.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and a non-nil error (likely gorm.ErrRecordNotFound).
Validation:
  This test is important for error handling and ensuring the function behaves correctly when no matching user is found, which is a common edge case in user lookups.

Scenario 3: Handle database connection error

Details:
  Description: This test simulates a database connection failure to ensure the function handles such errors gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that returns a connection error when queried.
  Act: Call GetByEmail with any email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and a non-nil error that reflects the database connection issue.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for error handling in production environments where database issues may occur. It ensures the function doesn't panic and properly propagates database errors.

Scenario 4: Retrieve user with empty email string

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when provided with an empty email string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with various user records.
  Act: Call GetByEmail with an empty string ("").
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and an appropriate error.
Validation:
  This test covers an edge case of invalid input. It's important to ensure the function handles this gracefully rather than causing unexpected behavior or database errors.

Scenario 5: Case sensitivity in email lookup

Details:
  Description: This test verifies whether the email lookup is case-sensitive or case-insensitive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a user record using a mixed-case email (e.g., "User@Example.com").
  Act: Call GetByEmail with the same email in different case (e.g., "user@example.com").
  Assert: Verify whether the function returns the correct user or not, depending on the expected behavior of the underlying database and ORM configuration.
Validation:
  This test is important for understanding and documenting the behavior of email lookups, which can vary depending on database configuration. It helps prevent potential bugs related to case sensitivity in email addresses.

Scenario 6: Performance with large dataset

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's performance when the database contains a large number of user records.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a large number of user records (e.g., 100,000+).
  Act: Call GetByEmail with an email that exists in the database.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct user within an acceptable time frame.
Validation:
  While this is more of a benchmark than a unit test, it's important to ensure that the function performs well under realistic conditions. This can help identify potential performance issues early.

Scenario 7: Handling of special characters in email

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles email addresses containing special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a user record that has an email containing special characters (e.g., "user+test@example.com").
  Act: Call GetByEmail with the special character email.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct user and doesn't encounter any SQL injection or escaping issues.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function safely handles various valid email formats and doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities when dealing with special characters.
```

These scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the `GetByEmail` function. They take into account the provided context, including the use of GORM and the structure of the `User` model.
