FUNCTION_DEF=func (s *UserStore) GetByEmail(email string) (*model.User, error)
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `GetByEmail` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully retrieve a user by email

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function can successfully retrieve a user when given a valid email address that exists in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a known user record.
  Act: Call GetByEmail with the email of the known user.
  Assert: Verify that the returned user matches the expected user data and that no error is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures the basic functionality of the method works as expected under normal conditions. It's crucial for verifying that user lookup by email, a common operation in authentication systems, functions correctly.

Scenario 2: Attempt to retrieve a non-existent user

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when queried with an email that doesn't exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database without any user records or with known user records that don't match the test email.
  Act: Call GetByEmail with an email that doesn't exist in the database.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and a non-nil error (likely gorm.ErrRecordNotFound).
Validation:
  This test is important for error handling and ensuring the function behaves correctly when no matching user is found. It helps prevent null pointer exceptions in calling code.

Scenario 3: Handle database connection error

Details:
  Description: This test simulates a database connection error to ensure the function handles it gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that returns a connection error when queried.
  Act: Call GetByEmail with any email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and a non-nil error that reflects the database connection issue.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for error handling in production environments where database connectivity issues may occur. It ensures the application can gracefully handle and report such errors.

Scenario 4: Retrieve user with maximum length email

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can handle an email address at the maximum allowed length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a user having an email address at the maximum allowed length (e.g., 254 characters for RFC 5321).
  Act: Call GetByEmail with this maximum length email.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct user and no error.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle edge cases related to input size, which is important for preventing potential truncation or overflow issues.

Scenario 5: Attempt retrieval with an empty email string

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when provided with an empty email string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database (content doesn't matter for this test).
  Act: Call GetByEmail with an empty string ("").
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and an appropriate error.
Validation:
  This test is important for input validation and ensures the function handles edge cases properly. It prevents potential SQL injection vulnerabilities and ensures meaningful error reporting for invalid inputs.

Scenario 6: Handle case sensitivity in email lookup

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the email lookup is case-insensitive, as email addresses are typically treated as case-insensitive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a user having a mixed-case email address.
  Act: Call GetByEmail with the same email address but in a different case.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct user regardless of the case used in the input.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the email lookup behaves correctly with regards to case sensitivity, which is important for user-friendly systems where users might input their email with varying capitalization.
```

These scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the `GetByEmail` function. They test the function's ability to handle successful retrievals, non-existent users, database errors, input validation, and case sensitivity, providing a comprehensive test suite for this particular function.
