FUNCTION_DEF=func (s *UserStore) GetByEmail(email string) (*model.User, error)
Here are several test scenarios for the `GetByEmail` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully retrieve a user by email

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function can correctly retrieve a user from the database when given a valid email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a known user entry.
  Act: Call GetByEmail with the email of the known user.
  Assert: Verify that the returned user matches the expected user data and that no error is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures the basic functionality of the method works as expected. It's crucial for validating that user lookups, which are likely a common operation, function correctly.

Scenario 2: Attempt to retrieve a non-existent user

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when querying for an email that doesn't exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database without any users or with known users that don't match the test email.
  Act: Call GetByEmail with an email that doesn't exist in the database.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and a non-nil error (likely gorm.ErrRecordNotFound).
Validation:
  This test is important for error handling and ensuring the function behaves correctly when no matching user is found.

Scenario 3: Handle database connection error

Details:
  Description: This test simulates a database connection failure to ensure the function handles such errors gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that returns a connection error when queried.
  Act: Call GetByEmail with any email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and a non-nil error that reflects the database connection issue.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for error handling in production environments where database issues may occur.

Scenario 4: Retrieve user with maximum length email

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can handle an email address at the maximum allowed length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a user having an email address at the maximum allowed length (e.g., 254 characters for RFC 5321).
  Act: Call GetByEmail with this maximum length email.
  Assert: Verify that the correct user is returned without errors.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle edge cases related to input size limitations.

Scenario 5: Attempt retrieval with an empty email string

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when provided with an empty email string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database (content doesn't matter for this test).
  Act: Call GetByEmail with an empty string ("").
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and an appropriate error.
Validation:
  This test is important for input validation and ensuring the function doesn't process invalid inputs.

Scenario 6: Handle case sensitivity in email lookup

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the email lookup is case-insensitive, as email addresses are typically treated as such.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a user having a mixed-case email address.
  Act: Call GetByEmail with the same email address but in a different case.
  Assert: Verify that the correct user is returned, regardless of the case used in the input.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to email address standards and provides a user-friendly lookup mechanism.

Scenario 7: Performance test with a large database

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function's performance when querying a large dataset.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a large number of user entries (e.g., 100,000+).
  Act: Call GetByEmail with an email that exists in the database.
  Assert: Verify that the correct user is returned within an acceptable time frame.
Validation:
  While not a functional test, this scenario is important for ensuring the method performs well under load, which is crucial for production environments.
```

These scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the `GetByEmail` function. They take into account the function's signature, the `UserStore` struct it belongs to, and the `model.User` type it returns. The scenarios also consider potential database interactions and error conditions that might occur in a real-world application.
