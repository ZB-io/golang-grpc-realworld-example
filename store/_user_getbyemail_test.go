FUNCTION_DEF=func (s *UserStore) GetByEmail(email string) (*model.User, error)
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `GetByEmail` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully retrieve a user by email

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function can successfully retrieve a user from the database when given a valid email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a known user entry, including a specific email address.
  Act: Call the GetByEmail function with the known email address.
  Assert: Verify that the returned user matches the expected user data and that no error is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures the basic functionality of the GetByEmail method works as expected. It's crucial for user authentication and profile retrieval operations in the application.

Scenario 2: Attempt to retrieve a non-existent user

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the function when queried with an email address that doesn't exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database without any user entries or with known user entries that don't match the test email.
  Act: Call the GetByEmail function with an email address known not to exist in the database.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and a non-nil error (likely a "record not found" error from GORM).
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure proper error handling when dealing with non-existent users, which is crucial for security and user management features.

Scenario 3: Handle database connection error

Details:
  Description: This test simulates a database connection failure to ensure the function handles such errors gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that simulates a connection error when queried.
  Act: Call the GetByEmail function with any email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and a non-nil error that reflects the database connection issue.
Validation:
  This test is critical for ensuring the application can handle infrastructure failures gracefully, providing appropriate error information for debugging and user feedback.

Scenario 4: Retrieve user with empty email string

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the function when provided with an empty email string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with various user entries.
  Act: Call the GetByEmail function with an empty string as the email parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and an appropriate error (likely a validation or "record not found" error).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function handles edge cases properly, preventing potential security issues or unexpected behavior when dealing with invalid input.

Scenario 5: Case sensitivity in email lookup

Details:
  Description: This test verifies whether the email lookup is case-sensitive or case-insensitive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a user entry using a mixed-case email address (e.g., "User@Example.com").
  Act: Call the GetByEmail function with the same email address but in a different case (e.g., "user@example.com").
  Assert: Verify whether the function returns the correct user or not, depending on the expected case sensitivity behavior of the database and ORM.
Validation:
  This test is important for understanding and documenting the exact behavior of email lookups, which can affect user experience and security implications in the authentication process.

Scenario 6: Performance with large dataset

Details:
  Description: This test assesses the performance of the function when dealing with a large number of user records.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a large number of user entries (e.g., 100,000+).
  Act: Call the GetByEmail function with an email known to be at the end of the dataset.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct user within an acceptable time frame (define a timeout threshold).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function performs efficiently with large datasets, which is crucial for maintaining responsiveness in a production environment with many users.

Scenario 7: Handling of special characters in email

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles email addresses containing special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with user entries having email addresses with special characters (e.g., "user+tag@example.com", "user.name@example.co.uk").
  Act: Call the GetByEmail function with these special email addresses.
  Assert: Verify that the function correctly retrieves the user for each special email address.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle a wide range of valid email formats, improving the robustness of the user lookup process.
```

These scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the `GetByEmail` function. They take into account the context provided by the package structure, imports, and related type definitions.
