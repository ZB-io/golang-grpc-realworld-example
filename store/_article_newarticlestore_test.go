FUNCTION_DEF=func NewArticleStore(db *gorm.DB) *ArticleStore
```
Scenario 1: Successful creation of an ArticleStore instance with a valid gorm.DB connection

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the NewArticleStore function correctly initializes and returns an ArticleStore instance when provided with a valid gorm.DB connection.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock or real gorm.DB connection that is valid and ready for use.
    Act: Call the NewArticleStore function with the prepared gorm.DB connection.
    Assert: Verify that the returned ArticleStore instance is not nil and that its db field matches the provided gorm.DB connection.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures that the function correctly initializes the ArticleStore with the provided database connection, which is crucial for the store's operations. This test is fundamental as it validates the basic functionality of the NewArticleStore function.

Scenario 2: Handling of nil gorm.DB connection

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the behavior of the NewArticleStore function when a nil gorm.DB connection is passed as an argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a nil gorm.DB connection.
    Act: Invoke the NewArticleStore function with the nil gorm.DB connection.
    Assert: Check that the returned ArticleStore instance is not nil and that its db field is nil.
  Validation:
    This test is important to ensure that the function can handle nil inputs gracefully without panicking, which is a common requirement for robust application design. It checks the defensive programming aspect of the function.

Scenario 3: Initialization with a gorm.DB connection that has logging enabled

Details:
  Description: This test scenario checks if the NewArticleStore function correctly initializes an ArticleStore instance when the provided gorm.DB connection has logging enabled.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a gorm.DB connection with logging enabled (logMode set to detailedLogMode).
    Act: Call the NewArticleStore function with the configured gorm.DB connection.
    Assert: Ensure that the returned ArticleStore instance is not nil and that its db field's logMode matches the detailedLogMode.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the logging configuration of the database connection is preserved in the ArticleStore, which is vital for debugging and monitoring the application's database interactions.

Scenario 4: Initialization with a gorm.DB connection that has custom callbacks

Details:
  Description: This test checks the NewArticleStore function's ability to handle a gorm.DB connection that has custom callbacks registered.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a gorm.DB connection and register custom callbacks (e.g., before create, after update).
    Act: Invoke the NewArticleStore function with the prepared gorm.DB connection.
    Assert: Verify that the returned ArticleStore instance is not nil and that its db field contains the registered callbacks.
  Validation:
    This scenario tests the function's capability to maintain the integrity and functionality of the database connection's callback mechanisms, which are essential for executing custom logic during database operations.

Scenario 5: Initialization with a gorm.DB connection that has a specific dialect configured

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates whether the NewArticleStore function correctly initializes an ArticleStore instance with a gorm.DB connection that has a specific SQL dialect configured.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a gorm.DB connection with a specific dialect (e.g., PostgreSQL).
    Act: Call the NewArticleStore function with the configured gorm.DB connection.
    Assert: Ensure that the returned ArticleStore instance is not nil and that its db field's dialect matches the configured dialect.
  Validation:
    This test is crucial for applications that rely on specific SQL dialects for their database operations, ensuring that the dialect settings are correctly propagated to the ArticleStore.

Scenario 6: Initialization with a gorm.DB connection that has a custom nowFuncOverride

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the NewArticleStore function correctly handles a gorm.DB connection that has a custom nowFuncOverride function for timestamp generation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a gorm.DB connection with a custom nowFuncOverride function.
    Act: Invoke the NewArticleStore function with the prepared gorm.DB connection.
    Assert: Verify that the returned ArticleStore instance is not nil and that its db field's nowFuncOverride matches the custom function.
  Validation:
    This scenario ensures that custom timestamp generation logic is preserved in the ArticleStore, which is important for applications that require specific timestamp handling for their database records.
