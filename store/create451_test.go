Scenario 1: Valid User Creation

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the function's ability to successfully create a valid user.
Execution:
  Arrange: A valid User object will be constructed, meeting all necessary field requirements.
  Act: The Create function will be invoked with the constructed User object.
  Assert: The returned error object should be nil.
Validation:
  The nil error object indicates that the user creation operation was successful.
  This test ensures that the Create function is able to handle nominal operation correctly, which aligns with general business requirements.

Scenario 2: Repeated User Creation

Details:
  Description: This test case is meant to check how the function handles an attempt to create a user with a username that is already in use.
Execution:
  Arrange: A User object will be constructed and registered using the Create function.
  Act: The Create function is invoked again using a User object with the same username.
  Assert: An error object is expected to be returned, signaling the failure of the user creation operation.
Validation:
  The error object serves as confirmation that the Create function correctly handles attempts to create duplicate usernames.
  The non-permission of duplicate usernames supports user identity integrity, a business requirement in a user management system.

Scenario 3: Empty User Creation

Details:
  Description: This scenario is meant to test the system's response when an attempt is made to create an empty user.
Execution:
  Arrange: An empty User object is created.
  Act: The Create function is called with the empty User object.
  Assert: The Create function is expected to return an error.
Validation:
  The returned error object validates that the Create function correctly handles invalid user creation scenarios.
  This test ensures that the rules constraining user creation are being properly enforced, maintaining data integrity in conformance with business requirements.


Scenario 4: Password less User Creation

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests how the system responds when an attempt is made to create a user without a password.
Execution:
  Arrange: A User object is created without a password.
  Act: Create function is invoked with the password-less User object.
  Assert: The Create function should return an error.
Validation:
  An error object commending that the Create function is functioning correctly as it should not allow a password-less user.
  The enforcement of password requirement contributes to user account security, which is a logical business need.
