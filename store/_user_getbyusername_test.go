FUNCTION_DEF=func (s *UserStore) GetByUsername(username string) (*model.User, error)
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `GetByUsername` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully retrieve a user by username

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function can successfully retrieve a user from the database when given a valid username.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a known user entry.
  Act: Call GetByUsername with the known username.
  Assert: Verify that the returned user matches the expected user data and that no error is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures the basic functionality of the method works as expected under normal conditions. It's crucial for validating that the database query is correctly formed and executed.

Scenario 2: Attempt to retrieve a non-existent user

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when querying for a username that doesn't exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database without the queried username.
  Act: Call GetByUsername with a non-existent username.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and a non-nil error (likely gorm.ErrRecordNotFound).
Validation:
  This test is important for error handling, ensuring the function correctly handles and reports when a user is not found.

Scenario 3: Handle database connection error

Details:
  Description: This test simulates a database connection failure to check error handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that returns a connection error.
  Act: Call GetByUsername with any username.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and a non-nil error reflecting the connection issue.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function properly handles and reports database-level errors, which is crucial for system reliability and debugging.

Scenario 4: Retrieve user with maximum length username

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can handle a username at the maximum allowed length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a user having a username at the maximum allowed length.
  Act: Call GetByUsername with this maximum length username.
  Assert: Verify that the correct user is returned without errors.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle edge cases related to input size, which is important for preventing potential truncation or overflow issues.

Scenario 5: Attempt retrieval with an empty username

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when provided with an empty string as the username.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database (content doesn't matter for this test).
  Act: Call GetByUsername with an empty string.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and an appropriate error.
Validation:
  This test is important for input validation, ensuring the function handles edge cases like empty inputs gracefully.

Scenario 6: Verify case sensitivity of username lookup

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the username lookup is case-sensitive as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a user "TestUser".
  Act: Call GetByUsername with "testuser" (all lowercase).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil user and a not found error.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function adheres to case-sensitivity requirements, which is important for maintaining data integrity and security in user identification.

Scenario 7: Handle special characters in username

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function can handle usernames containing special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database with a user having a username with special characters (e.g., "test@user_123").
  Act: Call GetByUsername with this special character username.
  Assert: Verify that the correct user is returned without errors.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle a variety of valid username formats, which is important for supporting diverse user inputs and preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.
```

These scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the `GetByUsername` function. They take into account the function's interaction with the database through GORM and consider various potential inputs and database states.
