### Scenario 1: Normal Operation - Successful Creation of ArticleStore

**Details:**
  - **Description:** This test checks that the `NewArticleStore` function correctly initializes and returns an `ArticleStore` instance with the provided `gorm.DB` connection.
  - **Execution:**
    - **Arrange:** Create a mock or real `gorm.DB` instance to pass as an argument to the function.
    - **Act:** Call the `NewArticleStore` function with the prepared `gorm.DB` instance.
    - **Assert:** Verify that the returned `ArticleStore` instance is not `nil` and that its `db` field matches the provided `gorm.DB` instance.
  - **Validation:**
    - The assertion ensures that the function correctly initializes the `ArticleStore` struct with the provided database connection.
    - This test is crucial as it validates the basic functionality of the `NewArticleStore` function, ensuring that it correctly sets up the `ArticleStore` for further database operations.

---

### Scenario 2: Edge Case - Nil DB Connection

**Details:**
  - **Description:** This test checks the behavior of the `NewArticleStore` function when a `nil` `gorm.DB` connection is passed as an argument.
  - **Execution:**
    - **Arrange:** Pass `nil` as the `gorm.DB` argument to the function.
    - **Act:** Call the `NewArticleStore` function with the `nil` argument.
    - **Assert:** Verify that the returned `ArticleStore` instance is not `nil` and that its `db` field is `nil`.
  - **Validation:**
    - The assertion ensures that the function handles a `nil` database connection gracefully by still returning an `ArticleStore` instance, albeit with a `nil` `db` field.
    - This test is important to ensure that the function does not panic or return an invalid state when provided with a `nil` database connection, which could happen in error scenarios or misconfigurations.

---

### Scenario 3: Edge Case - Multiple Instances with Different DB Connections

**Details:**
  - **Description:** This test checks that the `NewArticleStore` function correctly initializes multiple `ArticleStore` instances with different `gorm.DB` connections.
  - **Execution:**
    - **Arrange:** Create two distinct `gorm.DB` instances (e.g., one for a test database and one for a production database).
    - **Act:** Call the `NewArticleStore` function twice, each time with a different `gorm.DB` instance.
    - **Assert:** Verify that the two returned `ArticleStore` instances are distinct and that their `db` fields match the respective `gorm.DB` instances provided.
  - **Validation:**
    - The assertion ensures that the function does not share or reuse the same `db` field across multiple `ArticleStore` instances.
    - This test is important to validate that the function can be used to create multiple independent `ArticleStore` instances, each with its own database connection, which is a common requirement in applications with multiple data sources.

---

### Scenario 4: Edge Case - DB Connection with Custom Configuration

**Details:**
  - **Description:** This test checks that the `NewArticleStore` function correctly initializes an `ArticleStore` instance with a `gorm.DB` connection that has custom configurations (e.g., custom logger, dialect, or callback settings).
  - **Execution:**
    - **Arrange:** Create a `gorm.DB` instance with custom configurations (e.g., set a custom logger or dialect).
    - **Act:** Call the `NewArticleStore` function with the custom-configured `gorm.DB` instance.
    - **Assert:** Verify that the returned `ArticleStore` instance has a `db` field that matches the custom-configured `gorm.DB` instance.
  - **Validation:**
    - The assertion ensures that the function correctly preserves any custom configurations applied to the `gorm.DB` instance.
    - This test is important to ensure that the function does not inadvertently override or ignore custom configurations, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

---

### Scenario 5: Error Handling - Invalid DB Connection

**Details:**
  - **Description:** This test checks the behavior of the `NewArticleStore` function when provided with an invalid or closed `gorm.DB` connection.
  - **Execution:**
    - **Arrange:** Create a `gorm.DB` instance and close its connection to simulate an invalid state.
    - **Act:** Call the `NewArticleStore` function with the invalid `gorm.DB` instance.
    - **Assert:** Verify that the returned `ArticleStore` instance is not `nil` and that its `db` field matches the invalid `gorm.DB` instance.
  - **Validation:**
    - The assertion ensures that the function does not attempt to validate or repair the `gorm.DB` connection, as this is outside its responsibility.
    - This test is important to ensure that the function does not introduce additional complexity or error handling for invalid database connections, which should be managed by the caller.

---

### Scenario 6: Edge Case - Concurrency Safety

**Details:**
  - **Description:** This test checks that the `NewArticleStore` function can be safely called concurrently without causing race conditions or data corruption.
  - **Execution:**
    - **Arrange:** Create a shared `gorm.DB` instance and prepare multiple goroutines to call the `NewArticleStore` function concurrently.
    - **Act:** Invoke the `NewArticleStore` function from multiple goroutines simultaneously, passing the shared `gorm.DB` instance.
    - **Assert:** Verify that all returned `ArticleStore` instances are distinct and that their `db` fields correctly reference the shared `gorm.DB` instance.
  - **Validation:**
    - The assertion ensures that the function does not introduce race conditions or data corruption when called concurrently.
    - This test is important to validate that the function can be safely used in concurrent environments, which is a common requirement in modern applications.

---

### Scenario 7: Edge Case - DB Connection with Logging Enabled

**Details:**
  - **Description:** This test checks that the `NewArticleStore` function correctly initializes an `ArticleStore` instance with a `gorm.DB` connection that has logging enabled.
  - **Execution:**
    - **Arrange:** Create a `gorm.DB` instance with logging enabled (e.g., set `logMode` to `detailedLogMode`).
    - **Act:** Call the `NewArticleStore` function with the logging-enabled `gorm.DB` instance.
    - **Assert:** Verify that the returned `ArticleStore` instance has a `db` field that matches the logging-enabled `gorm.DB` instance.
  - **Validation:**
    - The assertion ensures that the function correctly preserves the logging configuration of the `gorm.DB` instance.
    - This test is important to ensure that the function does not inadvertently disable or override logging settings, which could hinder debugging and monitoring efforts.

---

### Scenario 8: Edge Case - DB Connection with Custom Callbacks

**Details:**
  - **Description:** This test checks that the `NewArticleStore` function correctly initializes an `ArticleStore` instance with a `gorm.DB` connection that has custom callbacks registered.
  - **Execution:**
    - **Arrange:** Create a `gorm.DB` instance and register custom callbacks (e.g., for `create`, `update`, or `delete` operations).
    - **Act:** Call the `NewArticleStore` function with the callback-configured `gorm.DB` instance.
    - **Assert:** Verify that the returned `ArticleStore` instance has a `db` field that matches the callback-configured `gorm.DB` instance.
  - **Validation:**
    - The assertion ensures that the function correctly preserves any custom callbacks registered on the `gorm.DB` instance.
    - This test is important to ensure that the function does not interfere with or override custom callbacks, which could affect the application's behavior during database operations.

---

### Scenario 9: Edge Case - DB Connection with Custom Dialect

**Details:**
  - **Description:** This test checks that the `NewArticleStore` function correctly initializes an `ArticleStore` instance with a `gorm.DB` connection that uses a custom dialect.
  - **Execution:**
    - **Arrange:** Create a `gorm.DB` instance with a custom dialect (e.g., for a specific database like PostgreSQL or MySQL).
    - **Act:** Call the `NewArticleStore` function with the custom-dialect-configured `gorm.DB` instance.
    - **Assert:** Verify that the returned `ArticleStore` instance has a `db` field that matches the custom-dialect-configured `gorm.DB` instance.
  - **Validation:**
    - The assertion ensures that the function correctly preserves the custom dialect configuration of the `gorm.DB` instance.
    - This test is important to ensure that the function does not interfere with or override the dialect settings, which could lead to compatibility issues with the underlying database.

---

### Scenario 10: Edge Case - DB Connection with Custom Search Configuration

**Details:**
  - **Description:** This test checks that the `NewArticleStore` function correctly initializes an `ArticleStore` instance with a `gorm.DB` connection that has custom search configurations (e.g., custom `whereConditions`, `joinConditions`, or `preload` settings).
  - **Execution:**
    - **Arrange:** Create a `gorm.DB` instance with custom search configurations (e.g., set `whereConditions` or `preload` settings).
