FUNCTION_DEF=func NewUserStore(db *gorm.DB) *UserStore 
Based on the provided function `NewUserStore` and the associated package information, here are several test scenarios:

```
Scenario 1: Create a new UserStore with a valid gorm.DB instance

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that NewUserStore correctly initializes a UserStore struct with a provided gorm.DB instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock or stub gorm.DB instance.
  Act: Call NewUserStore with the mock gorm.DB instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned UserStore is not nil and contains the provided gorm.DB instance.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the UserStore is properly initialized and contains the correct gorm.DB instance. This test is crucial to ensure the basic functionality of creating a new UserStore, which is fundamental for database operations in the application.

Scenario 2: Create a new UserStore with a nil gorm.DB instance

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of NewUserStore when provided with a nil gorm.DB instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed.
  Act: Call NewUserStore with a nil gorm.DB instance.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a non-nil UserStore, but with a nil db field.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles nil input gracefully. While it might not be a common use case, it's important to verify that the function doesn't panic and returns a valid UserStore struct, even if its db field is nil. This helps prevent potential nil pointer dereferences later in the application.

Scenario 3: Verify that multiple calls to NewUserStore with the same gorm.DB instance create distinct UserStore objects

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that each call to NewUserStore creates a new, distinct UserStore object, even when using the same gorm.DB instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock or stub gorm.DB instance.
  Act: Call NewUserStore twice with the same gorm.DB instance.
  Assert: Verify that the two returned UserStore pointers are different but contain the same gorm.DB instance.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that NewUserStore creates new instances each time it's called, rather than returning a cached or shared instance. This behavior is crucial for maintaining proper isolation between different parts of the application that might use separate UserStore instances.

Scenario 4: Check that the UserStore created by NewUserStore has the correct type

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the object returned by NewUserStore is of the correct type (UserStore).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock or stub gorm.DB instance.
  Act: Call NewUserStore with the mock gorm.DB instance.
  Assert: Use type assertion or reflection to confirm that the returned object is of type *UserStore.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function returns an object of the expected type. While this might seem obvious, it's a good practice to verify the type explicitly, especially in languages like Go where interfaces are implicitly implemented. This helps catch any inadvertent changes to the return type that might break type expectations elsewhere in the code.

Scenario 5: Verify that NewUserStore doesn't modify the provided gorm.DB instance

Details:
  Description: This test checks that NewUserStore doesn't alter the state of the gorm.DB instance passed to it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock or stub gorm.DB instance and record its initial state.
  Act: Call NewUserStore with the mock gorm.DB instance.
  Assert: Verify that the state of the gorm.DB instance hasn't changed after the function call.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that NewUserStore is a pure function with respect to its input. It should only use the gorm.DB instance to initialize the UserStore, not modify it. This helps maintain predictable behavior and prevents unexpected side effects that could impact other parts of the application using the same gorm.DB instance.
```

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `NewUserStore` function, including normal operation, edge cases, and type safety. They aim to ensure that the function behaves correctly under different conditions and maintains the expected contract with its callers.
