FUNCTION_DEF=func NewUserStore(db *gorm.DB) *UserStore
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `NewUserStore` function:

```
Scenario 1: Create a new UserStore with a valid gorm.DB instance

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that NewUserStore correctly initializes a UserStore struct with a provided gorm.DB instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock or stub gorm.DB instance.
  Act: Call NewUserStore with the mock gorm.DB instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned UserStore is not nil and contains the provided gorm.DB instance.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic functionality of NewUserStore works as expected. It's crucial to verify that the function correctly initializes the UserStore struct, as this is the foundation for all user-related database operations in the application.

Scenario 2: Create a new UserStore with a nil gorm.DB instance

Details:
  Description: This test checks how NewUserStore handles a nil gorm.DB instance, which could occur due to a configuration error or database connection failure.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a nil gorm.DB instance.
  Act: Call NewUserStore with the nil gorm.DB instance.
  Assert: Verify that the function still returns a non-nil UserStore, but with a nil db field.
Validation:
  While the current implementation doesn't explicitly handle nil inputs, this test is important to understand the function's behavior in edge cases. It helps identify potential improvements in error handling or input validation.

Scenario 3: Verify UserStore immutability

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that multiple calls to NewUserStore with the same gorm.DB instance result in distinct UserStore instances.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock gorm.DB instance.
  Act: Call NewUserStore twice with the same gorm.DB instance.
  Assert: Verify that the two returned UserStore instances are not the same object in memory, even though they contain the same gorm.DB instance.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that each call to NewUserStore creates a new, independent UserStore instance. This prevents unintended shared state between different parts of the application using separate UserStore instances.

Scenario 4: Check UserStore field accessibility

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the db field of the UserStore is accessible and matches the provided gorm.DB instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock gorm.DB instance with a unique identifier.
  Act: Call NewUserStore with the mock gorm.DB instance.
  Assert: Verify that the db field of the returned UserStore is accessible and matches the provided gorm.DB instance.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the UserStore correctly encapsulates the gorm.DB instance and that it can be accessed for database operations. It's crucial for the proper functioning of methods that will be implemented on the UserStore struct.

Scenario 5: Performance test for NewUserStore

Details:
  Description: This test measures the performance of NewUserStore to ensure it's efficient for frequent calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock gorm.DB instance.
  Act: Call NewUserStore multiple times (e.g., 10000 times) in a loop, measuring the total execution time.
  Assert: Verify that the average time per call is below a certain threshold (e.g., 100 nanoseconds).
Validation:
  While NewUserStore is a simple function, this performance test ensures that it remains efficient even when called frequently. This is important for applications that might create multiple UserStore instances during their lifecycle.

```

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `NewUserStore` function, including normal operation, edge cases, and performance considerations. They aim to ensure the function behaves correctly and reliably in different situations.
