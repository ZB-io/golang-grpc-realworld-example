Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of an article by ID

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the GetByID function is able to successfully retrieve an article from the database using its ID. It will cover the case where the function is given a valid ID and there's an article in the database with that ID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the database to return a specific article when the Find function is called with a certain ID. 
    Act: Invoke GetByID with the ID that was set up in the mock database.
    Assert: Check that the returned article matches the one that was set up in the mock database, and that no error was returned.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that GetByID correctly retrieves an article from the database when given a valid ID. This is important for the application's behavior as users should be able to view articles by their ID.

Scenario 2: Attempted retrieval of a non-existent article

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the GetByID function correctly handles the case where it's asked to retrieve an article with an ID that doesn't exist in the database. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the database to return a "record not found" error when the Find function is called with a certain ID.
    Act: Invoke GetByID with the ID that was set up in the mock database.
    Assert: Check that an error was returned and that the returned article is nil.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that GetByID correctly handles a "record not found" error. This is important for the application's behavior as users should be informed when they try to view an article that doesn't exist.

Scenario 3: Database error during retrieval of an article

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the GetByID function correctly handles a database error that occurs while trying to retrieve an article. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the database to return a generic error when the Find function is called.
    Act: Invoke GetByID with any ID.
    Assert: Check that the same error that was set up in the mock database was returned and that the returned article is nil.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that GetByID correctly handles a database error. This is important for the application's behavior as it should be able to gracefully handle any database errors that occur.
