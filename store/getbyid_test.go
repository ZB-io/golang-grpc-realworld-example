Scenario 1: Regular Successful Operation
Details:
    Description: This test case is meant to check the primary functionality of the `GetByID` function. The aim here is to determine if the given function can successfully retrieve an article from the database using its ID. 
Execution:
    Arrange: The required data like a sample article is set up in the database with known ID and associated tags and author details. A mock of `gorm.DB` is created which, upon invocation of `Find(&m, id)` function, will retrieve the corresponding ‘Article’ from the database.
    Act: The function `GetByID` is invoked with the ID of the pre-setup article.
    Assert: Using Go testing functionalities, it is checked whether the return value of the function matches the pre-setup article data in the database.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion validates whether the function properly retrieves data from the database given the correct ID. This test is important as it checks the primary operation of the function. The function should be able to return correct data for valid input. 

Scenario 2: Invalid Article ID
Details:
    Description: This test aims to check how the function handles the scenario when the provided ID does not exist in the database. It will validate the function's error handling capabilities.
Execution:
    Arrange: The 'gorm.DB' mock, when invokes `Find(&m, id)`, shall return a `record not found` error as no article has been setup with that ID in the database.
    Act: The function `GetByID` is invoked with an ID that does not exist in the database.
    Assert: It should be asserted that the function returns a `record not found` error.
Validation:
    The assertion ensures that the function correctly handles invalid IDs by returning proper error messages. This test checks the function's robustness and ability to handle erroneous scenarios, which is critical in ensuring that the application behaves as expected and prevents crashes or undefined behavior.

Scenario 3: Database Connection Issue
Details:
    Description: This test verifies whether the function can handle database connection issues correctly.
Execution:
    Arrange: The `gorm.DB` mock is set up in such a way that it will return a `database connection error` when `Find(&m, id)` is invoked.
    Act: The function `GetByID` is invoked with a valid ID.
    Assert: The function is expected to return an appropriate database error.
Validation:
    The assertion validates whether the function correctly handles the database errors or not. This test is crucial as it covers the scenario of database connection issues which can often happen in real-world scenarios, and the function should be able to identify and return the appropriate error message.
