ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=GetCommentByID_333cab101b

Scenario 1: Successful Retrieval of Comment
Details:
    Description: This test validates that `GetCommentByID` appropriately fetches and returns a comment given a valid ID. The expected behavior is for a comment struct to be returned without errors.
Execution:
   Arrange: A setup involving a mock database setup with some predetermined comments is needed. A valid comment id, matching one of the stored comments, should be chosen.
   Act: Call `GetCommentByID` with the chosen comment ID.
  Assert: Verify that the returned comment matches the comment belonging to the passed id in the mock DB and that there are no errors.
Validation:
   This test validates that the function is able to correctly retrieve values from the database and return it to the user without errors. This is essential for retrieving and viewing of comments in the application.

Scenario 2: Comment ID Does not Exist in Database
Details:
  Description: Validates the case when `GetCommentByID` is called for a comment ID that does not exist in the database. The expected behavior is for the call to return a nil comment and an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: A mock database should be set up, however, an arbitrary ID that doesn't match any comment in the database should be chosen.
  Act: Call `GetCommentByID` with the chosen ID.
  Assert: Verify that the returned comment is nil and the returned error is not nil.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function can handle cases where the comment ID does not exist in the database. This scenario is possible and handling it avoids unnecessary crashes when a nonexistent comment ID is queried.

Scenario 3: Database connection error
Details:
  Description: Validates the function behavior when there's a database connection error - for example, database server not running or wrong database credentials. We expect the call to return a nil comment and a database error.
Execution:
  Arrange: We would simulate a database connection error - this might involve creating a new database instance with wrong connection parameters or shutting down the existing database server.
  Act: Call `GetCommentByID` with a valid comment id.
  Assert: Verify that the returned comment is nil and a database connection error is returned.
Validation:
  This validates that the function is able to correctly handle cases where there's a database connection error. It's important to ensure that system errors such as a database connection issues are properly handled and the correct errors are propagated for logging and debugging purposes.
