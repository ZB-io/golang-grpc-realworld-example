ROOST_METHOD_HASH=GetByEmail_3574af40e5
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=GetByEmail_5731b833c1

Scenario 1: User Exists in the Database 

Details:
    Description: This scenario will test the normal operation of the function where it retrieves an existing user by their email address.
Execution:
    Arrange: We will need a dummy user saved into the database. For instance, a user with the email address "test@example.com".
    Act: Call `GetByEmail("test@example.com")`.
    Assert: We will verify that the returned user struct equals the dummy user we created and that there's no error returned.
Validation:
    Assertion checks if the function correctly retrieved the user from the database. This is crucial, as this function is used to pull the user data for further processing, e.g., during authentication. 

Scenario 2: User Does Not Exist in the Database

Details:
    Description: This test is for when the function attempts to retrieve a user that doesn't exist in the database.
Execution:
    Arrange: Empty the test database or at least ensure the email address we are going to test with does not exist.
    Act: Call `GetByEmail("nonexistent@email.com")`.
    Assert: We will verify that the function returns nil for the User and a "record not found" error.
Validation:
    The assertion guarantees that the function correctly handles scenarios where a user doesn't exist. For instance, it should not return a panic error or a blank User when the email doesn't exist.

Scenario 3: Invalid Email Address Passed

Details:
    Description: This scenario checks the case where an invalid (malformed) email address is passed to the function.
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare an invalid email address, e.g., "invalidEmail".
    Act: Call `GetByEmail("invalidEmail")`.
    Assert: Assert that the returned error value has a meaningful message indicating the incorrect email address, and it returns nil for the User. 
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function can correctly reject invalid input. This prevents processing incorrect or potentially harmful data, contributing to the robustness of the software.

Scenario 4: Empty Email Address Passed

Details:
    Description: This scenario deals with a situation where an empty string is passed as an email.
Execution:
    Arrange: An empty email address will be used to test this scenario.
    Act: Call `GetByEmail("")`.
    Assert: Assert that the function throws an error signaling that the email cannot be empty, and User returned is nil.
Validation:
    This assertion is critical as it ensures the function correctly handles cases where the email address string is empty. As a result, the function should not try to fetch a record from the database, which could lead to unexpected results or a wastage of resources.
