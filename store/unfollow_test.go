ROOST_METHOD_HASH=Unfollow_57959a8a53
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Unfollow_8bd8e0bc55

Scenario 1: Successful Unfollow
Details: 
  Description: This test will check if the Unfollow function successfully deletes the association of user B from the list of people followed by user A. This means user A is unfollowing user B.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two user records, user A and user B. Add user B's record in the follows association list of user A.
  Act: Call the Unfollow function with the instances of user A and user B.
  Assert: Verify that B is no longer in user A's Follows list.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the Unfollow function has correctly eliminated the association between user A and user B. This is crucial for user interaction and to ensure less intrusion from non-desired connections.

Scenario 2: Unfollow Non-existing User
Details: 
  Description: The test aims to verify whether the Unfollow function would handle the situation when user A tries to unfollow a user who doesnâ€™t exist in their Follows list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare instances of user A and user B, without user B in the Follows list of user A.
  Act: Call the Unfollow method with user A and user B.
  Assert: Check if an error is returned.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function sufficiently handles attempts to unfollow a user who isn't followed initially. It helps avoid inconsistency in the users' list. 

Scenario 3: Unfollow with NULL User
Details:
  Description: This test is to confirm that the Unfollow function can handle null inputs without causing a system error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of user A. Do not declare user B.
  Act: Call the Unfollow function with user A and user B(NULL).
  Assert: An error should be returned.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies the function's ability to safely handle null inputs, helping maintain data integrity by preventing the linkage of undefined or non-existent users.

Scenario 4: Pass Empty User Instances
Details:
  Description: This test to check if the Unfollow function can handle empty User instances.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate user A and user B without any data.
  Act: Use the Unfollow function with both user A and B.
  Assert: Check for an error.
Validation:
  This test assures error handling for empty inputs. It's important to handle such scenarios to avoid system errors and database corruption. 

Scenario 5: User Unfollows Self
Details: 
  Description: This test will check how the Unfollow function handles a situation when a user tries to unfollow himself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of user A and add them to their own Follows list.
  Act: Call the Unfollow function with user A for both the parameters.
  Assert: Ensure an error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the function for logical errors, i.e., a user unfollowing themselves. It's important to ensure the user database remains logically consistent.
