### Scenario 1: Successful User Update

Details:
- Description: This test verifies that a user's information is successfully updated when valid credentials and updated data are provided.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Mock `auth.GetUserID` to return a valid user ID. Mock `store.UserStore.GetByID` to return a mock user object. Mock `Validate`, `HashPassword`, and `store.UserStore.Update` methods to return no error. Set the `UpdateUserRequest` with updated user fields.
  - Act: Call the `UpdateUser` function with the prepared context and request.
  - Assert: Check that a `UserResponse` with updated user details is returned and no errors occur.
- Validation:
  - Ensure `UserResponse` contains updated user information and a new token. Validate through method mocking that data flow follows the path for successful updates.
  - Important for verifying successful user information updates in the application.

### Scenario 2: Unauthenticated User Request

Details:
- Description: Test handling of requests from unauthenticated users, expected to return an "Unauthenticated" error.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Mock `auth.GetUserID` to return an error, simulating an unauthenticated user.
  - Act: Invoke the `UpdateUser` function with invalid authentication context.
  - Assert: Expect an `Unauthenticated` error code and a `nil` response.
- Validation:
  - Checks function response to unauthenticated access attempts, ensuring security is emphasized.
  - Ensures only authenticated users can proceed with updates, crucial for preserving account integrity.

### Scenario 3: User Not Found

Details:
- Description: Test the behavior when a valid token exists, but the user is not found in the store.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Mock `auth.GetUserID` to return a valid ID. Mock `store.UserStore.GetByID` to return an error simulating a missing user.
  - Act: Call `UpdateUser` with a valid context but no corresponding user entry.
  - Assert: Expect a `NotFound` error code and a `nil` response.
- Validation:
  - Verifies handling of valid tokens that do not map to database users.
  - Important for scenarios where user data integrity is crucial and synchronization between database and tokens is necessary.

### Scenario 4: Input Validation Failure

Details:
- Description: Verify handling of invalid user input which does not meet validation criteria.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Mock `auth.GetUserID` and `store.UserStore.GetByID` to return valid values. Mock `Validate` to return a validation error.
  - Act: Invoke `UpdateUser` with invalid user data.
  - Assert: Expect an `InvalidArgument` error code with an error message detailing validation issues.
- Validation:
  - Confirms correct rejection of updates with invalid user data, crucial for maintaining data constrains.
  - Ensures user's data follows applicationâ€™s business rules.

### Scenario 5: Password Hashing Failure

Details:
- Description: Check response when password hashing fails during an update request.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Mock a user with `GetPassword` returning non-empty, trigger `HashPassword` to return an error.
  - Act: Call the `UpdateUser` function.
  - Assert: Expect an `Aborted` error code with a message regarding the hashing operation failure.
- Validation:
  - Ensures password integrity, specifically addressing potential move to an unstable state due to hashing failures.
  - Reinforces security practices in password management within application updates.

### Scenario 6: User Update Failure

Details:
- Description: Test for handling failure when updating user to the database due to a database issue.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Mock successful data preparation, but make `store.UserStore.Update` return an error.
  - Act: Call the `UpdateUser` function with valid data but an update operation failure condition.
  - Assert: Expect an `InvalidArgument` error code due to database update failure.
- Validation:
  - Evaluates the application's consistency and robustness in handling failed persistence operations.
  - Ensures graceful handling and reporting for operational failures, aligning with application reliability goals.

### Scenario 7: Token Generation Failure

Details:
- Description: Test scenario where token generation fails after a successful user update.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Mock methods to succeed until `auth.GenerateToken` fails.
  - Act: Call `UpdateUser` with successful update checkpoints but failing token generation.
  - Assert: Expect an `Aborted` error code, indicating token generation issues.
- Validation:
  - Demonstrates error handling for aspects downstream user updates, ensuring functional backup upon token generation failure.
  - Valid for real-world operations where token issuance can fail yet returning a coherent process response is necessary.
