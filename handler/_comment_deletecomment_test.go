FUNCTION_DEF=func (h *Handler) DeleteComment(ctx context.Context, req *pb.DeleteCommentRequest) (*pb.Empty, error)
Here are several test scenarios for the DeleteComment function:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully delete a comment

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that a user can successfully delete their own comment on an article.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Create a mock ArticleStore that returns a valid comment matching the user ID
    - Prepare a valid DeleteCommentRequest with correct slug and comment ID
  Act:
    - Call DeleteComment with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an empty response and no error
    - Confirm that the ArticleStore's DeleteComment method was called with the correct comment
Validation:
  This test ensures the happy path works correctly, validating that authorized users can delete their own comments. It's crucial for basic functionality and user experience.

Scenario 2: Attempt to delete a comment without authentication

Details:
  Description: This test checks that an unauthenticated request to delete a comment is rejected.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context that fails authentication
    - Prepare a valid DeleteCommentRequest
  Act:
    - Call DeleteComment with the unauthenticated context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with Unauthenticated status code
    - Ensure no calls are made to UserStore or ArticleStore
Validation:
  This test is important for security, ensuring that only authenticated users can perform deletions.

Scenario 3: Attempt to delete a non-existent comment

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior when trying to delete a comment that doesn't exist.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Create a mock ArticleStore that returns an error when getting the comment
    - Prepare a DeleteCommentRequest with an invalid comment ID
  Act:
    - Call DeleteComment with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with InvalidArgument status code
    - Confirm that no deletion attempt was made
Validation:
  This test ensures proper error handling for invalid input, maintaining data integrity.

Scenario 4: Attempt to delete a comment from another user

Details:
  Description: This test checks that a user cannot delete a comment made by another user.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Create a mock ArticleStore that returns a valid comment with a different user ID
    - Prepare a valid DeleteCommentRequest
  Act:
    - Call DeleteComment with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with InvalidArgument status code and "forbidden" message
    - Confirm that no deletion attempt was made
Validation:
  This test is crucial for maintaining user boundaries and preventing unauthorized actions.

Scenario 5: Attempt to delete a comment with mismatched article slug

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that a comment cannot be deleted if the provided article slug doesn't match the comment's article.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Create a mock ArticleStore that returns a valid comment
    - Prepare a DeleteCommentRequest with a mismatched slug
  Act:
    - Call DeleteComment with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with InvalidArgument status code and "the comment is not in the article" message
    - Confirm that no deletion attempt was made
Validation:
  This test ensures data consistency and prevents potential exploits by mismatching comment and article IDs.

Scenario 6: Handle database error during comment deletion

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when a database error occurs during comment deletion.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Create a mock ArticleStore that returns a valid comment but fails on deletion
    - Prepare a valid DeleteCommentRequest
  Act:
    - Call DeleteComment with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with InvalidArgument status code and "failed to delete comment" message
Validation:
  This test ensures proper error handling for database failures, maintaining system reliability.

Scenario 7: Handle invalid comment ID format

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's response to a non-integer comment ID in the request.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Prepare a DeleteCommentRequest with a non-integer comment ID
  Act:
    - Call DeleteComment with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with InvalidArgument status code and "invalid article id" message
    - Confirm that no further processing occurs after ID conversion failure
Validation:
  This test ensures robust input validation, preventing potential issues from malformed requests.
```

These scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the DeleteComment function. They test authentication, authorization, data validation, and error responses, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the function's behavior.
