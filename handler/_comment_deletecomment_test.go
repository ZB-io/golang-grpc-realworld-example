FUNCTION_DEF=func (h *Handler) DeleteComment(ctx context.Context, req *pb.DeleteCommentRequest) (*pb.Empty, error)
Here are several test scenarios for the `DeleteComment` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully Delete a Comment

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that a user can successfully delete their own comment on an article.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Set up a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Set up a mock ArticleStore that returns a valid comment owned by the user
    - Create a valid DeleteCommentRequest with matching slug and comment ID
  Act:
    - Call the DeleteComment function with the arranged context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an empty response and no error
    - Check that the ArticleStore's DeleteComment method was called with the correct comment

Validation:
  This test ensures the happy path works correctly, validating that users can delete their own comments when all conditions are met. It's crucial for basic functionality and user experience.

Scenario 2: Attempt to Delete a Comment from Another User

Details:
  Description: This test checks that a user cannot delete a comment that belongs to another user.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Set up a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Set up a mock ArticleStore that returns a valid comment owned by a different user
    - Create a valid DeleteCommentRequest
  Act:
    - Call the DeleteComment function with the arranged context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with the "forbidden" message
    - Check that the ArticleStore's DeleteComment method was not called

Validation:
  This test is important for security, ensuring that users can only delete their own comments and not those of others.

Scenario 3: Attempt to Delete a Non-existent Comment

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior when trying to delete a comment that doesn't exist.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Set up a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Set up a mock ArticleStore that returns an error when trying to get the comment
    - Create a DeleteCommentRequest with a non-existent comment ID
  Act:
    - Call the DeleteComment function with the arranged context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with the "failed to get comment" message
    - Check that the ArticleStore's DeleteComment method was not called

Validation:
  This test ensures proper error handling for non-existent resources, which is important for system robustness and user feedback.

Scenario 4: Attempt to Delete a Comment with Invalid ID Format

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when given an invalid comment ID format.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Set up a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Create a DeleteCommentRequest with an invalid (non-integer) comment ID
  Act:
    - Call the DeleteComment function with the arranged context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with the "invalid article id" message
    - Check that neither GetCommentByID nor DeleteComment methods were called on ArticleStore

Validation:
  This test is crucial for input validation, ensuring the system can handle and properly respond to incorrectly formatted data.

Scenario 5: Attempt to Delete a Comment with Mismatched Slug

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that a comment cannot be deleted if the provided slug doesn't match the comment's article.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Set up a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Set up a mock ArticleStore that returns a valid comment
    - Create a DeleteCommentRequest with a slug that doesn't match the comment's article ID
  Act:
    - Call the DeleteComment function with the arranged context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with the "the comment is not in the article" message
    - Check that the ArticleStore's DeleteComment method was not called

Validation:
  This test ensures data integrity by preventing deletion of comments from incorrect articles, which is important for maintaining proper relationships between comments and articles.

Scenario 6: Attempt to Delete a Comment with Unauthenticated User

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the user is not authenticated.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock context that fails authentication
    - Create a valid DeleteCommentRequest
  Act:
    - Call the DeleteComment function with the arranged context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with the "unauthenticated" message
    - Check that no methods on UserStore or ArticleStore were called

Validation:
  This test is critical for security, ensuring that only authenticated users can perform delete operations on comments.

Scenario 7: Attempt to Delete a Comment when User Retrieval Fails

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior when the system fails to retrieve the current user's information.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Set up a mock UserStore that returns an error when trying to get the user
    - Create a valid DeleteCommentRequest
  Act:
    - Call the DeleteComment function with the arranged context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with the "user not found" message
    - Check that no methods on ArticleStore were called

Validation:
  This test ensures proper error handling for database or system failures in user retrieval, which is important for system reliability and proper error reporting.
```

These scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the `DeleteComment` function. They test authentication, authorization, data validation, and various error conditions that could occur during the comment deletion process.
