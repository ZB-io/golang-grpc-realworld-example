FUNCTION_DEF=func (h *Handler) DeleteComment(ctx context.Context, req *pb.DeleteCommentRequest) (*pb.Empty, error)
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `DeleteComment` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully delete a comment

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that a comment is successfully deleted when all conditions are met (authenticated user, valid comment ID, comment belongs to the user and article).
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Create a mock ArticleStore that returns a valid comment matching the user and article
    - Prepare a valid DeleteCommentRequest with correct slug and comment ID
  Act:
    - Call the DeleteComment function with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an empty response and no error
    - Check that the ArticleStore's DeleteComment method was called with the correct comment
Validation:
  This test ensures the happy path works as expected, validating that authorized users can delete their own comments from the correct article. It's crucial for basic functionality and user experience.

Scenario 2: Attempt to delete a comment with unauthenticated user

Details:
  Description: This test checks that an unauthenticated user cannot delete a comment.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context that fails authentication
    - Prepare a valid DeleteCommentRequest
  Act:
    - Call the DeleteComment function with the unauthenticated context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with Unauthenticated status code
    - Ensure no calls are made to UserStore or ArticleStore
Validation:
  This test is important for security, ensuring that only authenticated users can perform delete operations on comments.

Scenario 3: Attempt to delete a comment with invalid comment ID

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function handles invalid comment IDs correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Prepare a DeleteCommentRequest with an invalid (non-integer) comment ID
  Act:
    - Call the DeleteComment function with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with InvalidArgument status code
    - Ensure no calls are made to ArticleStore's GetCommentByID or DeleteComment methods
Validation:
  This test ensures proper input validation, preventing potential errors or security issues from malformed requests.

Scenario 4: Attempt to delete a non-existent comment

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior when trying to delete a comment that doesn't exist.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Create a mock ArticleStore that returns an error when GetCommentByID is called
    - Prepare a valid DeleteCommentRequest
  Act:
    - Call the DeleteComment function with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with InvalidArgument status code
    - Ensure no call is made to ArticleStore's DeleteComment method
Validation:
  This test is important for handling edge cases and ensuring the system behaves correctly when dealing with non-existent data.

Scenario 5: Attempt to delete a comment from a different article

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that a user cannot delete a comment by providing a mismatched article slug.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Create a mock ArticleStore that returns a valid comment
    - Prepare a DeleteCommentRequest with a slug that doesn't match the comment's article ID
  Act:
    - Call the DeleteComment function with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with InvalidArgument status code
    - Ensure no call is made to ArticleStore's DeleteComment method
Validation:
  This test ensures data integrity by preventing users from deleting comments from articles they don't belong to.

Scenario 6: Attempt to delete another user's comment

Details:
  Description: This test checks that a user cannot delete a comment that belongs to another user.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Create a mock ArticleStore that returns a valid comment with a different user ID
    - Prepare a valid DeleteCommentRequest
  Act:
    - Call the DeleteComment function with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with InvalidArgument status code and "forbidden" message
    - Ensure no call is made to ArticleStore's DeleteComment method
Validation:
  This test is crucial for security and data ownership, ensuring users can only delete their own comments.

Scenario 7: Handle database error during comment deletion

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when a database error occurs during comment deletion.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user
    - Create a mock ArticleStore that:
      - Returns a valid comment matching the user and article
      - Returns an error when DeleteComment is called
    - Prepare a valid DeleteCommentRequest
  Act:
    - Call the DeleteComment function with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with InvalidArgument status code and "failed to delete comment" message
Validation:
  This test ensures proper error handling and reporting when database operations fail, which is crucial for system reliability and debugging.
```

These test scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the `DeleteComment` function. They address authentication, input validation, data integrity, authorization, and error handling aspects of the function.
