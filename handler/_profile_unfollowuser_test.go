FUNCTION_DEF=func (h *Handler) UnfollowUser(ctx context.Context, req *pb.UnfollowRequest) (*pb.ProfileResponse, error)
Here are several test scenarios for the `UnfollowUser` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successful Unfollow

Details:
  Description: Test the successful unfollowing of a user by an authenticated user.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create mock UserStore with two users: currentUser and requestUser
    - Set up the UserStore to return that currentUser is following requestUser
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser with a valid UnfollowRequest containing requestUser's username
  Assert:
    - Expect a ProfileResponse with requestUser's profile and following set to false
    - Verify that the Unfollow method was called on UserStore
Validation:
  This test ensures the core functionality of unfollowing works correctly when all conditions are met. It's crucial for verifying the main user interaction flow of the application.

Scenario 2: Unauthenticated User Attempt

Details:
  Description: Test the behavior when an unauthenticated user attempts to unfollow someone.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context that fails authentication
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser with any valid UnfollowRequest
  Assert:
    - Expect an error with Unauthenticated gRPC code
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles and reports authentication failures, which is critical for maintaining application security.

Scenario 3: User Not Found

Details:
  Description: Test the scenario where the user to unfollow doesn't exist.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create mock UserStore that returns "user not found" error for GetByUsername
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser with a non-existent username
  Assert:
    - Expect an error with NotFound gRPC code
Validation:
  This test ensures proper error handling when trying to unfollow a non-existent user, maintaining data integrity and providing clear feedback.

Scenario 4: Attempting to Unfollow Self

Details:
  Description: Test the case where a user attempts to unfollow themselves.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create mock UserStore that returns the same user for both GetByID and GetByUsername
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser with the authenticated user's own username
  Assert:
    - Expect an error with InvalidArgument gRPC code
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function prevents illogical operations, enhancing user experience and data consistency.

Scenario 5: Not Following the User

Details:
  Description: Test the scenario where the current user is not following the requested user.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create mock UserStore with two users
    - Set IsFollowing to return false
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser with a valid username
  Assert:
    - Expect an error with Unauthenticated gRPC code
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles attempts to unfollow users that aren't being followed, maintaining logical user relationships.

Scenario 6: Database Error During Unfollow

Details:
  Description: Test the handling of a database error during the unfollow operation.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create mock UserStore that returns an error for the Unfollow method
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser with a valid username
  Assert:
    - Expect an error with Aborted gRPC code
Validation:
  This test verifies proper error handling for database failures, ensuring the application degrades gracefully under unexpected conditions.

Scenario 7: Successful Unfollow with Multiple Followers

Details:
  Description: Test unfollowing when the target user has multiple followers.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create mock UserStore with multiple users following the target user
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser for one of the followers
  Assert:
    - Expect a successful ProfileResponse
    - Verify that only the specific follower relationship was removed
Validation:
  This test ensures that unfollowing works correctly in a more complex user relationship scenario, verifying that other follower relationships remain intact.
```

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `UnfollowUser` function, including successful operation, error handling, edge cases, and different user relationship scenarios. They aim to thoroughly test the function's behavior under different conditions, ensuring robustness and correctness of the implementation.
