FUNCTION_DEF=func (h *Handler) UnfollowUser(ctx context.Context, req *pb.UnfollowRequest) (*pb.ProfileResponse, error)
Here are several test scenarios for the `UnfollowUser` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successful Unfollow

Details:
  Description: Test the successful unfollowing of a user when all conditions are met.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create mock UserStore with two users: currentUser and requestUser
    - Set up the UserStore to return that currentUser is following requestUser
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser with a valid UnfollowRequest containing requestUser's username
  Assert:
    - Expect a ProfileResponse with requestUser's profile and following status as false
    - Verify that the Unfollow method was called on the UserStore
Validation:
  This test ensures the core functionality of unfollowing works as expected when all preconditions are met. It's crucial for verifying the main user interaction flow of the application.

Scenario 2: Unauthenticated User

Details:
  Description: Test the behavior when an unauthenticated user attempts to unfollow.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context that fails to provide a valid user ID
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser with any valid UnfollowRequest
  Assert:
    - Expect a gRPC error with Unauthenticated code
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles authentication failures, which is critical for maintaining application security.

Scenario 3: User Not Found

Details:
  Description: Test the scenario where the current user is not found in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Configure UserStore to return an error when GetByID is called
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser with any valid UnfollowRequest
  Assert:
    - Expect a gRPC error with NotFound code
Validation:
  This test ensures proper error handling when database inconsistencies occur, which is important for system reliability.

Scenario 4: Attempting to Unfollow Self

Details:
  Description: Test the case where a user attempts to unfollow themselves.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a user for GetByID
    - Set up an UnfollowRequest with the same username as the current user
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser with the prepared request
  Assert:
    - Expect a gRPC error with InvalidArgument code
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function prevents illogical operations, maintaining data integrity and user experience.

Scenario 5: Target User Not Found

Details:
  Description: Test the behavior when the user to be unfollowed doesn't exist.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Configure UserStore to return a valid current user but fail to find the target user
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser with a non-existent username
  Assert:
    - Expect a gRPC error with NotFound code
Validation:
  This test ensures proper handling of requests for non-existent users, which is important for data consistency and user feedback.

Scenario 6: Not Following the Target User

Details:
  Description: Test the case where the current user attempts to unfollow a user they're not following.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Configure UserStore to return valid users but indicate they're not in a following relationship
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser with a valid target username
  Assert:
    - Expect a gRPC error with Unauthenticated code
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles the state of user relationships, preventing invalid operations.

Scenario 7: Database Error During Unfollow Operation

Details:
  Description: Test the handling of a database error during the unfollow operation.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up all preconditions for a successful unfollow
    - Configure UserStore to return an error when Unfollow is called
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser with a valid request
  Assert:
    - Expect a gRPC error with Aborted code
Validation:
  This test ensures proper error handling for database operations, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and providing appropriate feedback to users.

Scenario 8: Successful Unfollow with Profile Return

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function returns the correct profile information after a successful unfollow.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up for a successful unfollow operation
    - Configure mock UserStore to return a specific profile for the unfollowed user
  Act:
    - Call UnfollowUser with a valid request
  Assert:
    - Expect a ProfileResponse with the correct user information and following status as false
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function not only performs the unfollow operation but also returns the updated profile information correctly, which is important for updating the UI accurately.
```

These test scenarios cover a wide range of cases including successful operations, various error conditions, edge cases, and verification of returned data. They aim to ensure the robustness and correctness of the UnfollowUser function across different situations it might encounter.
