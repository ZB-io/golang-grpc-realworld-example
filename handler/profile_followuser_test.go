ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=FollowUser_bf8ceb04bb

Here are multiple test scenarios for the `FollowUser` function, considering normal operations, edge cases, and error conditions:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully Follow Another User

Details:
  Description: Verify that a user can successfully follow another user who exists and is different from the current user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user store to return the current user and the target user when queried by ID and username, respectively.
  Act: Invoke `FollowUser` with a valid `FollowRequest` for a different user.
  Assert: Check that the returned `ProfileResponse` contains a profile with the expected `Profile` data and indicates a successful follow operation.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 2: Unauthenticated User Tries to Follow

Details:
  Description: Ensure that an unauthenticated user cannot follow another user, and an error is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the auth mock to simulate failure in retrieving the user ID from the context.
  Act: Call `FollowUser` with a request while the context has no valid authentication token.
  Assert: Expect an error with `Unauthenticated` status code to be returned.
Validation:
  Validate that the function correctly checks for authentication, as user authentication is crucial for secure operations.

Scenario 3: Follow Non-Existent Target User

Details:
  Description: Verify that a proper error is returned when trying to follow a non-existent user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the user store to return the current user but return an error when querying for the target user by username.
  Act: Invoke `FollowUser` with a username that does not exist in the system.
  Assert: The returned error should have a `NotFound` status code.
Validation:
  Ensures robust handling of input errors, preventing operations on invalid targets, which is important for maintaining data integrity.

Scenario 4: Current User Follows Themselves

Details:
  Description: Test that attempting to follow oneself is disallowed and results in an appropriate error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user store to return a user with the same username as the follow request.
  Act: Call `FollowUser` with a username equal to that of the current user.
  Assert: Expect an error with `InvalidArgument` status code indicating self-follow is not allowed.
Validation:
  This prevents a logical inconsistency where a user follows themselves, which may cause unexpected behavior in other parts of the system.

Scenario 5: Current User Cannot Be Found By ID

Details:
  Description: Ensure that the system correctly handles the case where the current user cannot be found in the database using their ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the user store to simulate a failure when retrieving the current user by ID.
  Act: Attempt to follow another user while the current user is not retrievable from the store.
  Assert: The function should return a `NotFound` error indicating failure to find the current user.
Validation:
  It confirms proper error handling when internal state assumptions are violated, which is essential for resilience against database inconsistencies.

Scenario 6: Failure To Follow Due To Backend Error

Details:
  Description: Test the function's response to an unforeseen backend error during the follow operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Program the user store to simulate an error occurring during the follow process.
  Act: Call the `FollowUser` function with valid parameters that trigger a backend error.
  Assert: Verify an `Aborted` status code error is returned indicating follow operation failure.
Validation:
  Verifies the function's robustness in the face of backend failures, ensuring clear and informative error handling.

Scenario 7: Follow Request With Empty Username

Details:
  Description: Check the function's behavior when given a follow request with an empty username.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a `FollowRequest` with an empty username field.
  Act: Execute the `FollowUser` function using the created request.
  Assert: The function should return an error with an appropriate status code such as `InvalidArgument`.
Validation:
  Ensures the function validates input requests properly, maintaining application reliability through input sanitization.
```

Each scenario is designed to probe different aspects and branches of the `FollowUser` function, ensuring comprehensive coverage of its expected behaviors and potential failure modes.
