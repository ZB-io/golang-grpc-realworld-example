FUNCTION_DEF=func (h *Handler) FollowUser(ctx context.Context, req *pb.FollowRequest) (*pb.ProfileResponse, error)
Here are several test scenarios for the `FollowUser` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successful User Follow

Details:
  Description: Test the successful following of one user by another.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create two mock users: currentUser and requestUser
    - Set up mock UserStore to return these users
    - Create a mock context with valid authentication
  Act:
    - Call FollowUser with the mock context and a FollowRequest containing requestUser's username
  Assert:
    - Expect a ProfileResponse with requestUser's profile and Following set to true
    - Verify that UserStore's Follow method was called with correct parameters
Validation:
  This test ensures the core functionality of following a user works correctly. It's crucial for the social aspect of the application.

Scenario 2: Attempt to Follow Self

Details:
  Description: Test the case where a user attempts to follow themselves.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock user
    - Set up mock UserStore to return this user
    - Create a mock context with valid authentication
  Act:
    - Call FollowUser with the mock context and a FollowRequest containing the user's own username
  Assert:
    - Expect an error with codes.InvalidArgument
    - Verify that UserStore's Follow method was not called
Validation:
  This test checks that the function correctly prevents users from following themselves, which is a logical constraint of the system.

Scenario 3: Follow Non-existent User

Details:
  Description: Test the behavior when trying to follow a user that doesn't exist.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock currentUser
    - Set up mock UserStore to return currentUser for GetByID, but return an error for GetByUsername
    - Create a mock context with valid authentication
  Act:
    - Call FollowUser with the mock context and a FollowRequest containing a non-existent username
  Assert:
    - Expect an error with codes.NotFound
    - Verify that UserStore's Follow method was not called
Validation:
  This test ensures proper error handling when the requested user to follow doesn't exist in the system.

Scenario 4: Unauthenticated Follow Attempt

Details:
  Description: Test the behavior when an unauthenticated user attempts to follow someone.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock context that simulates an authentication failure
  Act:
    - Call FollowUser with the mock context and a valid FollowRequest
  Assert:
    - Expect an error with codes.Unauthenticated
    - Verify that UserStore methods were not called
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles authentication failures and prevents unauthorized access.

Scenario 5: Database Error During Follow Operation

Details:
  Description: Test the behavior when a database error occurs during the follow operation.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create mock currentUser and requestUser
    - Set up mock UserStore to return these users successfully
    - Configure UserStore's Follow method to return an error
    - Create a mock context with valid authentication
  Act:
    - Call FollowUser with the mock context and a FollowRequest containing requestUser's username
  Assert:
    - Expect an error with codes.Aborted
    - Verify that UserStore's Follow method was called with correct parameters
Validation:
  This test ensures proper error handling when a database operation fails, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and providing appropriate feedback.

Scenario 6: Successfully Follow Previously Unfollowed User

Details:
  Description: Test following a user that was previously unfollowed.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create mock currentUser and requestUser
    - Set up mock UserStore to return these users
    - Configure UserStore to simulate requestUser not being followed initially
    - Create a mock context with valid authentication
  Act:
    - Call FollowUser with the mock context and a FollowRequest containing requestUser's username
  Assert:
    - Expect a ProfileResponse with requestUser's profile and Following set to true
    - Verify that UserStore's Follow method was called with correct parameters
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles re-following a previously unfollowed user, which is important for the social dynamics of the application.
```

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `FollowUser` function, including successful operation, error handling, edge cases, and potential database issues. They aim to ensure the function behaves correctly under different circumstances and maintains the integrity of the application's social following feature.
