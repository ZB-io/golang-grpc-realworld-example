FUNCTION_DEF=func (h *Handler) GetArticles(ctx context.Context, req *pb.GetArticlesRequest) (*pb.ArticlesResponse, error)
Here are several test scenarios for the `GetArticles` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of articles with default limit

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when retrieving articles without specifying a limit, ensuring it uses the default limit of 20.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ArticleStore with at least 20 articles. Create a GetArticlesRequest with no limit specified.
  Act: Call GetArticles with the prepared request.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ArticlesResponse contains 20 articles and the ArticlesCount is 20.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the default limit of 20 is applied when no limit is specified in the request. It's crucial for maintaining consistent behavior and preventing potential overload from large result sets.

Scenario 2: Retrieval of articles with specified limit and offset

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly applies user-specified limit and offset values when retrieving articles.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock ArticleStore with at least 30 articles. Create a GetArticlesRequest with a limit of 10 and an offset of 5.
  Act: Call GetArticles with the prepared request.
  Assert: Check that the returned ArticlesResponse contains 10 articles, starting from the 6th article in the store.
Validation:
  This test confirms that pagination works correctly, allowing clients to retrieve specific subsets of articles. It's essential for implementing efficient data loading in user interfaces.

Scenario 3: Filtering articles by tag

Details:
  Description: Test the function's ability to filter articles based on a specified tag.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ArticleStore with articles having various tags. Create a GetArticlesRequest with a specific tag.
  Act: Call GetArticles with the prepared request.
  Assert: Verify that all returned articles in the ArticlesResponse contain the specified tag.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the tag filtering functionality works correctly, which is crucial for allowing users to find articles on specific topics.

Scenario 4: Filtering articles by author

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function can filter articles based on the author's username.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock ArticleStore with articles from various authors. Create a GetArticlesRequest with a specific author username.
  Act: Call GetArticles with the prepared request.
  Assert: Check that all articles in the returned ArticlesResponse are authored by the specified user.
Validation:
  This test confirms the author filtering functionality, which is important for users who want to view articles from specific writers.

Scenario 5: Filtering articles by favorited status

Details:
  Description: Test the function's ability to filter articles that have been favorited by a specific user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up mock ArticleStore and UserStore with articles and users, some articles being favorited. Create a GetArticlesRequest with a 'favorited' username.
  Act: Call GetArticles with the prepared request.
  Assert: Verify that all returned articles in the ArticlesResponse are favorited by the specified user.
Validation:
  This test ensures that users can retrieve articles they've favorited, which is important for personalized content features.

Scenario 6: Handling non-existent favorited user

Details:
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when a non-existent username is provided in the 'favorited' field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up mock stores. Create a GetArticlesRequest with a non-existent username in the 'favorited' field.
  Act: Call GetArticles with the prepared request.
  Assert: Check that the function returns an empty list of articles instead of an error.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function gracefully handles cases where the favorited username doesn't exist, preventing errors and allowing the query to continue with other filters.

Scenario 7: Error handling for database failure

Details:
  Description: Test the function's error handling when the database operation fails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ArticleStore that returns an error when GetArticles is called. Prepare a valid GetArticlesRequest.
  Act: Call GetArticles with the prepared request.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a gRPC error with the Aborted code and an appropriate error message.
Validation:
  This test ensures that database errors are properly handled and communicated to the client, which is crucial for maintaining system reliability and providing meaningful feedback.

Scenario 8: Handling authenticated user for favorited status

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly determines the favorited status of articles for an authenticated user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up mock stores with articles and users. Create a context with a valid user ID. Prepare a GetArticlesRequest.
  Act: Call GetArticles with the authenticated context and request.
  Assert: Check that the favorited status in the returned articles is correct for the authenticated user.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately reflects the favorited status for authenticated users, which is important for personalized article views.

Scenario 9: Handling unauthenticated user for favorited status

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when determining favorited status for an unauthenticated user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up mock stores. Create a context without a user ID. Prepare a GetArticlesRequest.
  Act: Call GetArticles with the unauthenticated context and request.
  Assert: Verify that all articles in the response have favorited set to false.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function handles unauthenticated users correctly, ensuring that no articles appear as favorited when there's no logged-in user.

Scenario 10: Verifying following status of article authors

Details:
  Description: Test that the function correctly determines the following status of article authors for the current user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up mock stores with users and their following relationships. Create an authenticated context. Prepare a GetArticlesRequest.
  Act: Call GetArticles with the authenticated context and request.
  Assert: Check that the following status in the author profile of each returned article is correct for the authenticated user.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately reflects the following status of article authors, which is important for providing context in article listings and enhancing user experience.
```

These test scenarios cover a wide range of functionality for the `GetArticles` function, including normal operations, edge cases, and error handling. They address the various filtering options, pagination, authentication states, and potential error conditions that the function might encounter.
