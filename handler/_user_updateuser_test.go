FUNCTION_DEF=func (h *Handler) UpdateUser(ctx context.Context, req *pb.UpdateUserRequest) (*pb.UserResponse, error)
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `UpdateUser` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully update user with all fields

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the UpdateUser function correctly updates all user fields when provided with valid input for each field.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user for GetByID
    - Prepare an UpdateUserRequest with new values for all fields
  Act:
    - Call UpdateUser with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the returned UserResponse contains the updated user information
    - Check that the UserStore's Update method was called with the correct user data
    - Ensure a new token was generated for the user
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it verifies the core functionality of updating a user's profile. It ensures that all fields can be updated simultaneously and that the function handles the happy path correctly.

Scenario 2: Update user with partial fields

Details:
  Description: This test checks that the UpdateUser function correctly updates only the provided fields, leaving others unchanged.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user for GetByID
    - Prepare an UpdateUserRequest with new values for only some fields (e.g., email and bio)
  Act:
    - Call UpdateUser with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that only the provided fields were updated in the returned UserResponse
    - Check that the unchanged fields retain their original values
    - Ensure the UserStore's Update method was called with the correct partial update
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function respects partial updates and doesn't modify fields that weren't explicitly provided in the request.

Scenario 3: Attempt to update user with invalid email

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the UpdateUser function correctly handles and rejects an invalid email update.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user for GetByID
    - Prepare an UpdateUserRequest with an invalid email address
  Act:
    - Call UpdateUser with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with codes.InvalidArgument
    - Check that the error message contains information about the email validation failure
    - Ensure the UserStore's Update method was not called
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring data integrity by verifying that the function properly validates input before attempting to update the user record.

Scenario 4: Update user with a new password

Details:
  Description: This test checks that the UpdateUser function correctly handles password updates, including hashing the new password.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user for GetByID
    - Prepare an UpdateUserRequest with a new password
  Act:
    - Call UpdateUser with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the returned UserResponse doesn't contain the plain text password
    - Check that the UserStore's Update method was called with a hashed password
    - Ensure a new token was generated for the user
Validation:
  This test is important for security, ensuring that passwords are properly hashed before storage and not returned in plain text.

Scenario 5: Attempt to update non-existent user

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the UpdateUser function correctly handles attempts to update a user that doesn't exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns an error for GetByID, simulating a non-existent user
    - Prepare a valid UpdateUserRequest
  Act:
    - Call UpdateUser with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with codes.NotFound
    - Check that the error message indicates the user was not found
    - Ensure the UserStore's Update method was not called
Validation:
  This test is crucial for error handling, ensuring that the function gracefully handles attempts to update non-existent users and provides appropriate error information.

Scenario 6: Attempt to update user with unauthenticated context

Details:
  Description: This test checks that the UpdateUser function correctly rejects requests from unauthenticated contexts.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context that fails authentication checks
    - Prepare a valid UpdateUserRequest
  Act:
    - Call UpdateUser with the unauthenticated context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with codes.Unauthenticated
    - Check that the error message indicates an authentication failure
    - Ensure no calls were made to the UserStore
Validation:
  This test is important for security, verifying that the function properly enforces authentication before allowing user updates.

Scenario 7: Handle internal server error during update

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the UpdateUser function correctly handles and reports internal server errors that occur during the update process.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user for GetByID but fails on Update
    - Prepare a valid UpdateUserRequest
  Act:
    - Call UpdateUser with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with codes.InvalidArgument (as per the function's implementation)
    - Check that the error message indicates an internal server error
    - Ensure the error is logged
Validation:
  This test is crucial for error handling and system reliability, ensuring that the function properly handles and reports internal errors without exposing sensitive information to the client.

Scenario 8: Attempt to update with a duplicate username

Details:
  Description: This test checks that the UpdateUser function correctly handles attempts to update a username to one that already exists in the system.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set up a mock context with a valid user ID
    - Create a mock UserStore that returns a valid user for GetByID but fails on Update due to a duplicate username
    - Prepare an UpdateUserRequest with a username that conflicts with an existing user
  Act:
    - Call UpdateUser with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error with codes.InvalidArgument
    - Check that the error message indicates a duplicate username issue
    - Ensure the error is logged
Validation:
  This test is important for data integrity and user experience, verifying that the function properly handles and reports attempts to use duplicate usernames, which should be unique in the system.
```

These test scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the `UpdateUser` function. They take into account the provided package structure, imports, and struct definitions to create realistic and comprehensive test cases.
