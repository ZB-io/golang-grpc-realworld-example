```
Scenario 1: Authenticate User Before Unfollowing

Details:
  Description: Ensure the function fails with an "unauthenticated" error when the user is not authenticated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a context without user credentials and create an `UnfollowRequest` with a valid username.
  Act: Invoke the `UnfollowUser` method using the unauthenticated context.
  Assert: Check if the error returned is `codes.Unauthenticated`.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that the function correctly identifies and rejects unauthenticated requests, which is essential for maintaining application security.

Scenario 2: Reject Self-Unfollowing

Details:
  Description: Test that the function returns an error when a user tries to unfollow themselves.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an authenticated context and `UnfollowRequest` with the requesting user's username.
  Act: Call `UnfollowUser` with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a `codes.InvalidArgument` error.
Validation:
  This test ensures logical correctness, preventing users from self-referencing follow actions, which doesn't make sense in real-world usage.

Scenario 3: Handling Non-Existent Current User

Details:
  Description: Check the response when the current user, fetched by ID, doesn't exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the context to simulate a user ID that cannot be matched in the database.
  Act: Invoke `UnfollowUser` with this setup.
  Assert: Confirm the error is `codes.NotFound` with the "user not found" message.
Validation:
  Tests the robustness of error handling for non-existent users, highlighting potential database discrepancies or context issues.

Scenario 4: Handling Non-Existent Request User

Details:
  Description: Test function behavior when the username to unfollow doesn't exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a valid context and an `UnfollowRequest` for a user not in the database.
  Act: Call the `UnfollowUser` method with these inputs.
  Assert: Ensure the error returned is `codes.NotFound` with "user was not found".
Validation:
  Important for maintaining data integrity, ensuring actions are performed only on existing entities.

Scenario 5: Check Following Status Before Unfollowing

Details:
  Description: Ensure that trying to unfollow a non-followed user returns an appropriate error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Context and `UnfollowRequest` for a user not currently followed by the authenticated user.
  Act: Execute the `UnfollowUser` method.
  Assert: Verify the error is `codes.Unauthenticated` indicating the user was not initially followed.
Validation:
  Validates logical consistency in the application, ensuring actions are valid and current.

Scenario 6: Successful Unfollow Execution

Details:
  Description: Confirm that the user successfully unfollows another user and the function returns the correct profile.
Execution:
  Arrange: A context and `UnfollowRequest` where the user is already following the target user.
  Act: Call `UnfollowUser` to unfollow.
  Assert: Check that no error is returned and the profile of the unfollowed user is returned correctly.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm correct application behavior and successful execution of the business requirement to unfollow a user.

Scenario 7: Unfollow Operation Fails

Details:
  Description: Ensure proper error is returned when the database unfollow operation fails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Context and `UnfollowRequest` where the database call to unfollow fails.
  Act: Invoke `UnfollowUser`.
  Assert: Validate that the error matches `codes.Aborted` with clear messaging about the unfollow failure.
Validation:
  Critical for confirming error-handling paths for unexpected database issues, maintaining robustness and reliability of the application.

Scenario 8: Verifying Logging Behavior

Details:
  Description: Ensure that significant steps and errors are correctly logged for diagnostic purposes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up logging mocks to capture output.
  Act: Trigger scenarios that result in expected and unexpected conditions.
  Assert: Check that the logs contain appropriate messages corresponding to each scenario outcome.
Validation:
  Logging is key for monitoring and debugging; this test ensures visibility into the process flow and error conditions.
