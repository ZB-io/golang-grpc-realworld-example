Here are several test scenarios for the `New` function in the specified Go package, using well-established Go testing practices:

### Scenario 1: Handler Creation with Valid Inputs

**Details:**
- Description: This test checks that the `New` function correctly creates a `Handler` when provided with valid logger, `UserStore`, and `ArticleStore` instances.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Create instances of `zerolog.Logger`, `store.UserStore`, and `store.ArticleStore`.
  - Act: Call `New` with these instances.
  - Assert: Verify that the returned `Handler` is not `nil` and that it contains the provided logger, `UserStore`, and `ArticleStore`.

**Validation:**
- The test asserts that all dependencies are appropriately assigned in the `Handler`, ensuring the function handles typical inputs correctly.
- This test is crucial for verifying that the `Handler` is constructed with the essential dependencies necessary for normal operations in the application.

### Scenario 2: Handler Creation with Nil Logger

**Details:**
- Description: This test examines the behavior of the `New` function when the logger parameter is `nil`.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Create instances of `store.UserStore` and `store.ArticleStore` with `nil` for the logger.
  - Act: Call `New` with a `nil` logger.
  - Assert: Ensure that the returned `Handler` is not `nil` and that the `logger` field in the `Handler` is `nil`.

**Validation:**
- The assertion confirms that the absence of a logger does not prevent the creation of a `Handler`.
- This scenario is significant for ensuring the function doesn't fail unexpectedly when optional dependencies aren't provided.

### Scenario 3: Handler Creation with Nil UserStore

**Details:**
- Description: This scenario tests the function's response to a `nil` `UserStore`.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an instance of `zerolog.Logger` with `nil` for the `UserStore`, and create a `store.ArticleStore`.
  - Act: Call `New` with these parameters.
  - Assert: Verify that the `us` field in the `Handler` is `nil`.

**Validation:**
- Asserting the flexibility of handling a missing `UserStore` ensures that the function can remain flexible under abnormal conditions.
- This test is relevant for robustness, confirming that the application can initialize parts even if some components are unavailable.

### Scenario 4: Handler Creation with Nil ArticleStore

**Details:**
- Description: This test checks how `New` handles the creation of a `Handler` when provided with a `nil` `ArticleStore`.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an instance of `zerolog.Logger` and `store.UserStore` with `nil` for the `ArticleStore`.
  - Act: Call `New` with these parameters.
  - Assert: Confirm the `as` field in the `Handler` is `nil`.

**Validation:**
- The test demonstrates whether other components can be initialized independently, which is vital for ensuring graceful handling of optional components.
- Recognizing missing subsystems without errors is important for the flexibility and reliability of the application.

### Scenario 5: Complete Nil Inputs

**Details:**
- Description: Test for expected behavior when all inputs are `nil`.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: No arrangement of non-nil objects, passing `nil` for all.
  - Act: Call `New` with `nil` for the logger, `UserStore`, and `ArticleStore`.
  - Assert: Validate the creation of a `Handler` where all three fields (`logger`, `us`, `as`) are `nil`.

**Validation:**
- By asserting that the function can handle entirely nil input, we ensure defensive programming practices are applied.
- This test validates that the application does not panic or crash, prioritizing stability and handling unexpected null states.

Each of these scenarios addresses different potential states of the inputs to the `New` function, aiming to ensure comprehensive testing by covering both typical and atypical situations.
