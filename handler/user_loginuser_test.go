Scenario 1: Successful User Login

Details:
  Description: Verify that the `LoginUser` function successfully logs in a user when provided with valid email and password credentials.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock `UserStore` that returns a user object when queried with a valid email. Ensure the user object has the correct password hash that matches the input password. Set up the logger and other dependencies.
  Act: Call `LoginUser` with a valid `LoginUserRequest` containing the user’s credentials.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a `UserResponse` with a user object that contains a valid token and no error.

Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assert the `UserResponse` contains a valid user object to ensure that valid credentials result in successful login. Verify there's no error.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures that the primary login flow works as expected for valid credentials.

Scenario 2: Invalid Email Login Attempt

Details:
  Description: Verify the system’s response when attempting to log in with an email that does not exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the mock `UserStore` to return an error for the email lookup to simulate an email that doesn't exist. Set up the necessary environment.
  Act: Invoke `LoginUser` with a `LoginUserRequest` using a non-existent email.
  Assert: Expect the function to return a `nil` response and an `InvalidArgument` error with a message indicating "invalid email or password".

Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Ensures the error handling for invalid email cases is correct by asserting the specific error code and message returned.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Guards against unauthorized access by testing valid error reporting on invalid inputs.

Scenario 3: Incorrect Password Attempt

Details:
  Description: Validate that the function correctly handles a situation where the user’s password is incorrect.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock `UserStore` that returns a user object for the given email, but ensure that the password check fails. Configure dependencies.
  Act: Invoke `LoginUser` with a `LoginUserRequest` containing the incorrect password.
  Assert: Verify that the response is `nil` and the error is an `InvalidArgument` with a message "invalid email or password".

Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Focus on ensuring proper error handling when passwords don't match, expecting the specific error code and message.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Prevents potential breaches by validating defensive mechanisms against incorrect password entries.

Scenario 4: Token Generation Failure

Details:
  Description: Ensure correct error management if there is a failure in token generation during login.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the token generation function to return an error, while setting up a valid user retrieval process.
  Act: Attempt to call `LoginUser` with valid user credentials.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `nil` with an error of `Aborted` indicating an internal server error.

Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Validate that system maintains integrity by returning the appropriate error upon internal failures.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Critical for maintaining reliability and user trust by correctly handling unexpected failures.

Scenario 5: Logging on User Login Attempts

Details:
  Description: Check that login attempts, both successful and unsuccessful, are logged correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock or intercept log outputs to capture log entries. Prepare test data for both successful and unsuccessful login attempts.
  Act: Execute `LoginUser` with correct and incorrect credentials separately.
  Assert: Examine logs to ensure specific messages are logged according to the login result (success or error scenarios).

Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Validate logging to ensure adequate monitoring and audit trails of login attempts.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Aids in diagnosing issues, provides security audit logs to track user actions.
