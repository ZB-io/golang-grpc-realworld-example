ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=GetComments_20efd5abae


Here are some test scenarios for the `GetComments` function:

```
Scenario 1: Valid Request with Existing Article

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that when a valid article ID is provided in the slug, the function returns the associated comments correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ArticleStore's GetByID method to return a valid article and GetComments to return a list of comments. Simulate a valid context.
  Act: Call the GetComments method with a properly formatted request containing an existing article slug.
  Assert: Verify that the returned CommentsResponse contains the correct number of comments with expected content.
Validation:
  This assertion checks the function's success path, ensuring it correctly fetches comments for an existing article. It's important for the function to handle typical requests efficiently.

Scenario 2: Invalid Slug That Cannot Be Converted to an Integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks the handling of an invalid slug that cannot be converted to an integer, expecting an error response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the request slug to a non-integer string.
  Act: Call the GetComments method with the malformed slug.
  Assert: Expect an error with code `codes.InvalidArgument`.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures input validation is effectively handled, crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing unexpected processing errors.

Scenario 3: Non-Existent Article ID

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns an error when the slug corresponds to a non-existent article ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ArticleStore's GetByID method to return an error indicating the article wasn't found.
  Act: Invoke GetComments with a slug representing a non-existent article ID.
  Assert: Expect an error response with code `codes.InvalidArgument`.
Validation:
  This test is essential for confirming that the application responds appropriately to references to non-existent resources, maintaining expected operational boundaries.

Scenario 4: Error Fetching Comments from the ArticleStore

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function's behavior when there is an issue retrieving comments from the article store.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the GetComments method in ArticleStore to return an error.
  Act: Call the GetComments function with a valid request.
  Assert: Expect an error response with code `codes.Aborted`.
Validation:
  This ensures robust error handling when storage layer interactions fail, maintaining user transparency and system stability.

Scenario 5: Valid Request with No Comments

Details:
  Description: Test the scenario where a valid article ID is used, but the article has no comments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the GetByID method to return a valid article and GetComments to return an empty list.
  Act: Invoke GetComments with a valid article slug.
  Assert: Check that the CommentsResponse has an empty comments list.
Validation:
  Verifying the handling of empty comment lists ensures that the function correctly processes articles without any comments, a common edge case.

Scenario 6: Current User Not Found

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles the scenario where the current user making the request cannot be found.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the auth.GetUserID to return a valid user ID. Then mock the UserStore.GetByID to return an error indicating user not found.
  Act: Call GetComments with the context of an unknown user.
  Assert: Expect an error code `codes.NotFound`.
Validation:
  This test ensures user-related errors are surfaced correctly, reflecting access control logic.

Scenario 7: Failure to Determine Follow Status

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests the reaction of the function when an error occurs while determining the following status between the current user and comment authors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the IsFollowing method to return an error.
  Act: Invoke GetComments under conditions where this method will be called.
  Assert: Expect an error code `codes.NotFound`.
Validation:
  Assessing follow-status logic failure prepares the application for unexpected relational data issues, essential for user relationship features.

Scenario 8: Unauthenticated User Request

Details:
  Description: Check behavior when the context lacks user authentication information, simulating a guest mode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up context without user identification information.
  Act: Call GetComments as an unauthenticated user.
  Assert: Ensure processing occurs without errors, returning the expected comments structure.
Validation:
  This scenario guarantees that the function accommodates unauthenticated access while maintaining comment visibility features without user-specific data. 
```

Each scenario has been designed to cover specific operational paths, edge cases, and error-resilience issues to ensure robust function behavior across different contexts.
