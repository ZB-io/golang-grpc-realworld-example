Scenario 1: Verify Successful Retrieval of Current User

Details:
  Description: This test checks the successful retrieval of the current user when a valid authentication token is present in the context. The function should return a user's details and token without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `auth.GetUserID` to return a valid user ID. Ensure `us.GetByID` returns a corresponding user object. Mock `auth.GenerateToken` to provide a valid token.
  Act: Call `CurrentUser` with a context containing a valid token.
  Assert: Check that the returned `UserResponse` matches the expected user data paired with a generated token. Ensure no errors are returned.
Validation:
  Use assertions to confirm that the `UserResponse` contains accurate user details reflecting a successful operation. This test is crucial as it validates normal behavior when the user is authenticated, maintaining user confidence in accessing their data.

Scenario 2: Handle Unauthenticated User

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that when a user is not authenticated (i.e., no valid token in context), the function returns an appropriate error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `auth.GetUserID` to return an error indicative of missing or invalid authentication.
  Act: Invoke `CurrentUser` with a context missing a valid token.
  Assert: Assert that the function responds with a `codes.Unauthenticated` error.
Validation:
  Validate the error type to ensure user authentication errors are correctly handled, essential for system security and unauthorized access prevention.

Scenario 3: Handle User Not Found in Database

Details:
  Description: Test the scenario where the token is valid, but no user corresponds to the userID in the database, resulting in a `NotFound` error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `auth.GetUserID` to return a valid user ID and `us.GetByID` to return an error indicating the user does not exist.
  Act: Call `CurrentUser` with a context that includes a valid token.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned error matches `codes.NotFound`.
Validation:
  Validating the appropriate error handling ensures database integrity issues are transparently communicated, aiding in diagnosis and user feedback.

Scenario 4: Handle Token Generation Failure

Details:
  Description: Assess the function's response to a failure during token generation after successfully finding a user, resulting in an `Aborted` error response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `auth.GetUserID` and `us.GetByID` to succeed, but `auth.GenerateToken` to return an error simulating a failure in token creation.
  Act: Execute `CurrentUser` with a valid user in context.
  Assert: Verify that the function responds with an `Aborted` code due to token generation failure.
Validation:
  This test ensures that hypothetical internal failures do not proceed unnoticed, supporting robust system behavior and aiding troubleshooting efforts.

Scenario 5: Verify Logger Call on Successful User Retrieval

Details:
  Description: Ensure that the logger is called with the appropriate message upon successful user retrieval, indicating successful tracking of operations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up mocks to mimic successful operations for `auth.GetUserID`, `us.GetByID`, and `auth.GenerateToken`. Use a spy to track logger messages.
  Act: Call `CurrentUser` and complete the user retrieval process.
  Assert: Check that the logger has recorded a success message corresponding to the user retrieval.
Validation:
  Monitoring logger outputs is pivotal for auditing, operational transparency, and debugging support, ensuring that successful operations are consistently logged.

Scenario 6: Verify Logger Call on Authentication Failure

Details:
  Description: Confirm that an error is logged when the authentication process fails, signifying vigilant error recording.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a failure in `auth.GetUserID` and attach a spy to the logger to monitor messages.
  Act: Attempt to retrieve the current user without proper authentication.
  Assert: Verify that the logger records an error message denoting an authentication failure.
Validation:
  This test underscores the significance of logging failures in the authentication process, reinforcing accountability and aiding in swift response to security challenges.
