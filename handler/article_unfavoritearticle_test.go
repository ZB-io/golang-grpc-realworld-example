  - **Act:** Call `UnfavoriteArticle`.
  - **Assert:** Confirm error is returned as `codes.InvalidArgument` specifying invalid article ID.

- **Validation:**  
  - Check input validation mechanisms that prevent operation on malformed slugs.
  - Supports ensuring data correctness in application operations.

### Scenario 5: Article Not Found with Given ID

**Details:**  
- **Description:** Scenario when the article requested by slug does not exist.
  
- **Execution:**
