FUNCTION_DEF=func (h *Handler) GetArticle(ctx context.Context, req *pb.GetArticleRequest) (*pb.ArticleResponse, error)
Here are several test scenarios for the `GetArticle` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully retrieve an article for an authenticated user

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function can successfully retrieve an article when provided with a valid slug and an authenticated user context.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock ArticleStore with a GetByID method that returns a valid article
    - Create a mock UserStore with GetByID and IsFollowing methods
    - Set up an authenticated context with a valid user ID
    - Prepare a GetArticleRequest with a valid slug
  Act:
    - Call GetArticle with the prepared context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the returned ArticleResponse is not nil
    - Check that the Article field in the response matches the expected article data
    - Ensure the Author field in the Article is correctly populated with following status
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it represents the primary happy path for retrieving an article. It ensures that all components (article retrieval, user authentication, following status) work together correctly.

Scenario 2: Retrieve an article for an unauthenticated user

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when retrieving an article without user authentication.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock ArticleStore with a GetByID method that returns a valid article
    - Prepare a GetArticleRequest with a valid slug
    - Use a context without authentication information
  Act:
    - Call GetArticle with the unauthenticated context and request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the returned ArticleResponse is not nil
    - Check that the Article field in the response matches the expected article data
    - Ensure the Author field in the Article does not have following status set
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function can still return article data for unauthenticated users, which is a common use case for public article viewing.

Scenario 3: Attempt to retrieve an article with an invalid slug

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns an appropriate error when given an invalid slug.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Prepare a GetArticleRequest with an invalid slug (e.g., non-numeric string)
  Act:
    - Call GetArticle with the prepared request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error
    - Check that the error is of type codes.InvalidArgument
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function properly handles and reports input validation errors, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and providing clear feedback to API consumers.

Scenario 4: Attempt to retrieve a non-existent article

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when trying to retrieve an article that doesn't exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock ArticleStore with a GetByID method that returns an error (simulating not found)
    - Prepare a GetArticleRequest with a valid but non-existent slug
  Act:
    - Call GetArticle with the prepared request
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error
    - Check that the error is of type codes.InvalidArgument
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles database lookup failures gracefully and returns an appropriate error to the client.

Scenario 5: Handle database error when checking if article is favorited

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's error handling when the database operation to check if an article is favorited fails.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create mock ArticleStore and UserStore that return valid data for initial queries
    - Set up the ArticleStore's IsFavorited method to return an error
    - Prepare a GetArticleRequest with a valid slug and an authenticated context
  Act:
    - Call GetArticle with the prepared request and context
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error
    - Check that the error is of type codes.Aborted
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles unexpected database errors correctly, providing appropriate error responses instead of exposing internal errors to the client.

Scenario 6: Handle database error when checking following status

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the database operation to check the following status fails.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create mock ArticleStore and UserStore that return valid data for initial queries
    - Set up the UserStore's IsFollowing method to return an error
    - Prepare a GetArticleRequest with a valid slug and an authenticated context
  Act:
    - Call GetArticle with the prepared request and context
  Assert:
    - Verify that the function returns an error
    - Check that the error is of type codes.NotFound
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring that the function handles unexpected database errors during the following status check, providing appropriate error responses to the client.

Scenario 7: Retrieve article with authenticated user who is not following the author

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles the case where an authenticated user retrieves an article but is not following the author.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create mock ArticleStore and UserStore that return valid data
    - Set up the UserStore's IsFollowing method to return false
    - Prepare a GetArticleRequest with a valid slug and an authenticated context
  Act:
    - Call GetArticle with the prepared request and context
  Assert:
    - Verify that the returned ArticleResponse is not nil
    - Check that the Article field in the response matches the expected article data
    - Ensure the Author field in the Article has following status set to false
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function correctly represents the following status in the response, which is crucial for accurately displaying user relationships in the UI.
```

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `GetArticle` function, including happy paths, error handling, and edge cases. They take into account the function's interaction with the database through the ArticleStore and UserStore, as well as authentication and authorization aspects.
