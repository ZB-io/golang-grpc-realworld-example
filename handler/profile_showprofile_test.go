Scenario 1: Show Profile with Valid Username and Authenticated User

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `ShowProfile` function successfully returns the profile information when a valid username is provided and the user is authenticated. It is a basic functionality test to ensure the nominal operation of the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock context that returns a valid user ID. Set up the `UserStore` mock to return a current user and a requested user with the specified username.
  Act: Invoke the `ShowProfile` function with a request containing a valid username.
  Assert: Verify that the response contains the profile of the requested user and that no error is returned.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion verifies that the function correctly retrieves and returns the requested user's profile without errors when all conditions are valid. 
  Discuss the importance of the test: This test ensures basic functionality, confirming that authenticated users can access profile information as expected, which is core to user experience.

Scenario 2: Show Profile with Unauthenticated User

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `ShowProfile` function returns an unauthenticated error when the context does not include a valid user ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock context that returns an error when attempting to fetch the user ID, simulating an unauthenticated user.
  Act: Invoke the `ShowProfile` function with the mock context and any username.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns a `codes.Unauthenticated` error.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The test checks the handling of authentication errors, which is crucial for enforcing access control.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Authentication is a critical aspect of the application, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain functionalities.

Scenario 3: Show Profile with Non-Existent Username

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates whether the `ShowProfile` function correctly returns a not found error when the requested username does not exist in the `UserStore`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid mock context with an authenticated user ID. Set up `UserStore` mocks to return the current user but fail when retrieving the requested user by username.
  Act: Call the `ShowProfile` function with a non-existent username.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a `codes.NotFound` error indicating the username was not found.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: It ensures the function correctly handles the scenario where a user requests a nonexistent profile, maintaining data integrity.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Accurate error reporting is essential for user feedback and system diagnostics, crucial for maintaining trust and usability.

Scenario 4: Show Profile with User Not Following Another User

Details:
  Description: This test assesses the functionality when the current user is not following the requested user, ensuring that the correct profile response is returned without the following status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock context with an authenticated user ID and `UserStore` instances to return both the current and requested users. Ensure the `IsFollowing` method of `UserStore` returns false.
  Act: Call `ShowProfile` with a valid username.
  Assert: Verify that the resulting profile response correctly indicates the user is not being followed.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Checking whether the following status is correctly set helps ensure accurate user relationships representation in the application.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Safe handling of follow relationships is vital for social features within the application, impacting user interaction and experience.

Scenario 5: Show Profile Internal Server Error on Follow Status Check

Details:
  Description: This test checks if `ShowProfile` can adequately handle and return an error when the `IsFollowing` method encounters an issue while determining the follow status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use mocks for context and `UserStore` to simulate a valid user and target user but force an error in the `IsFollowing` call.
  Act: Execute the `ShowProfile` function with valid input.
  Assert: Validate that a `codes.Internal` error is returned, indicating a failure in processing the follow status.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Testing error paths helps verify robustness and the application's ability to handle unexpected conditions gracefully.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Handling unexpected internal errors is essential for service reliability and user assurance, keeping the system resilient.

Each scenario is designed to cover different aspects of the `ShowProfile` function, ensuring comprehensive testing of its functionality, error handling, and edge cases.
