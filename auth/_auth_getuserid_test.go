FUNCTION_DEF=func GetUserID(ctx context.Context) (uint, error)
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `GetUserID` function:

```
Scenario 1: Valid Token with Correct User ID

Details:
  Description: Test the function with a valid JWT token containing a correct user ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a context with a valid JWT token containing a known user ID.
  Act: Call GetUserID with the prepared context.
  Assert: Check if the returned user ID matches the one in the token, and that no error is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly extracts and returns the user ID from a valid token. It's crucial for verifying the basic functionality of the authentication system.

Scenario 2: Expired Token

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when provided with an expired JWT token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a context with an expired JWT token.
  Act: Call GetUserID with the prepared context.
  Assert: Verify that an error is returned with the message "token expired", and the user ID is 0.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles expired tokens, which is a critical security feature in JWT-based authentication systems.

Scenario 3: Malformed Token

Details:
  Description: Test the function's response to a malformed JWT token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a context with a malformed JWT token (e.g., missing parts or incorrect format).
  Act: Call GetUserID with the prepared context.
  Assert: Check that an error is returned with the message "invalid token: it's not even a token", and the user ID is 0.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function can properly identify and reject malformed tokens, which is essential for security and preventing potential attacks.

Scenario 4: Missing Token in Context

Details:
  Description: Test the function when no token is present in the context.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty context without any token.
  Act: Call GetUserID with the empty context.
  Assert: Verify that an error is returned (likely from grpc_auth.AuthFromMD), and the user ID is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles cases where authentication information is missing, which is important for maintaining secure access control.

Scenario 5: Token with Invalid Claims Type

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when the token's claims cannot be mapped to the expected claims struct.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a context with a JWT token that has claims of an unexpected type.
  Act: Call GetUserID with the prepared context.
  Assert: Check that an error is returned with the message "invalid token: cannot map token to claims", and the user ID is 0.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles tokens with unexpected claim structures, which is important for maintaining the integrity of the authentication system.

Scenario 6: Valid Token but Expired According to ExpiresAt Claim

Details:
  Description: Test the function with a token that passes JWT validation but has an expired ExpiresAt claim.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a context with a JWT token that has a valid signature but an ExpiresAt time in the past.
  Act: Call GetUserID with the prepared context.
  Assert: Verify that an error is returned with the message "token expired", and the user ID is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function performs the additional expiration check using the ExpiresAt claim, which adds an extra layer of security beyond the standard JWT validation.

Scenario 7: Valid Token with Maximum Possible User ID

Details:
  Description: Test the function with a valid token containing the maximum possible uint value for UserID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a context with a valid JWT token containing the maximum uint value for UserID.
  Act: Call GetUserID with the prepared context.
  Assert: Check if the returned user ID matches the maximum uint value, and that no error is returned.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function can handle extreme values for UserID without overflow or other issues, ensuring robustness in edge cases.

Scenario 8: Valid Token with Minimum Possible User ID (1)

Details:
  Description: Test the function with a valid token containing the minimum valid UserID (assuming 0 is not a valid user ID).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a context with a valid JWT token containing a UserID of 1.
  Act: Call GetUserID with the prepared context.
  Assert: Verify that the returned user ID is 1, and no error is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the lower bound of valid user IDs, which is important for maintaining data integrity and preventing potential issues with special or reserved user IDs.
```

These test scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling situations for the `GetUserID` function. They address various aspects of token validation, claim parsing, and error reporting, which are crucial for the security and reliability of the authentication system.
