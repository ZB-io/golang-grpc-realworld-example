Scenario 1: Successful Token Generation

  Details:
    Description: This test aims to check the correct functionality of the `generateToken` function when valid parameters are supplied. It checks if the function successfully generates a token and doesn't return an error.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An arbitrary `id` and `now` parameters will be provided to the function.
    Act: Invoke the `generateToken` function with the arranged parameters.
    Assert: The function should return a non-empty string (token) and no error.
  Validation:
    The assertion involves checking if a valid token is generated and no errors are encountered. A successful token generation scenario ensures users can authenticate their actions using this token.

Scenario 2: Token Generation Error

  Details:
    Description: This test aims to check the behavior of the `generateToken` function when there is an error during token generation. This scenario checks if the function can handle unexpected errors during token generation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Configure the function so that it returns an error during token signing. For instance, you can mock jwt.SigningString method in a way that it returns an error.
    Act: Invoke the `generateToken` function.
    Assert: The function should return an error.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks if an error is returned when token signing fails. By handling unexpected errors during token generation, the function ensures that the application doesn't abruptly fail.

Scenario 3: Token Expiry Validation

  Details:
    Description: This scenario tests whether a generated token has a correct expiration time as instructed. The test checks if the function sets the expiration time of the token correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Generate a token for a user with a known id and `now` is the current time.
    Act: Invoke the `generateToken` function and parse the returned token to extract its expiry time.
    Assert: The extracted expiry time should be equal to `now + 72 hours` (i.e., `now.Add(time.Hour * 72).Unix()`).
  Validation:
    The assertion checks if the token's expiry time is correct. It assures the token's lifespan reflects expected business rules, to prevent improper access.

Scenario 4: Validation of id field in token claims

  Details:
    Description: This test checks whether the `id` provided during token generation is correctly set in the token claims. It verifies the integrity of the `id` in the returned token.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Generate a token for a user with a known id.
    Act: Invoke the `generateToken` function and parse the returned token to extract the `id`.
    Assert: The extracted `id` should be equal to the id provided during token generation.
  Validation:
    The assertion validates if the correct `id` is embedded in the token. This ensures the token can be reliably used to authenticate the respective user.
