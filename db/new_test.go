ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=New_f9cc65f555

Scenario 1: Successful Database Connection
Details:
    Description: This test will validate that the New function can successfully open a connection to the database.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the "gorm.Open" function to return nil error.
    Act: Call the New function.
    Assert: Assert that the returned error from the New function is nil and that the returned DB object is not nil.
Validation:
    The assertion checks whether the function managed to establish a working connection with the database. This is critical to ensure the function behaves as expected in a production environment where a database connection is required.

Scenario 2: Database Connection Retry Logic
Details:
    Description: The test will validate whether the New function retries for a successful database connection in an event of failure up to the stipulated maximum attempts.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the instance to make the gorm.Open method error out the first few times when the New method calls it, and then finally return a nil error.
    Act: Call the New function.
    Assert: The error returned by the New function should not be nil. The DB connection object should not be nil.
Validation:
    The test assertion validates that the function retries the connection until it's successful, ensuring the resilience of the application during sporadic connection failures or delays.

Scenario 3: All Connection Attempts Failed
Details:
    Description: This test will ensure the New function returns an error if all attempts made to connect to the database fail.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the "gorm.Open" function to return a connection error until the maximum number of attempts defined in the function.
    Act: Invoke the New function.
    Assert: Assert that the function raised an error and the returned DB object is nil.
Validation:
    This test validates the error handling capability of the connection logic, thus ensuring the application does not proceed with further operations when a database connection could not be established.

Scenario 4: Database Connection Settings
Details:
    Description: Test to confirm appropriate configurations are set during a successful database connection.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the "gorm.Open" function to return a successful connection, and keep track of the configurations set.
    Act: Invoke the New function.
    Assert: Confirm the configurations "SetMaxIdleConns" & "LogMode" were set as expected.
Validation:
    This test validates the setting of optimum configuration during a database connection to ensure desired performance and debuggability.

// go test functions require a capital `Test` prefix to run.
// This is a consequence of Go's exporting rules, and cannot be overridden through the test command.
//
// ERROR FIXES:
// - The errors mentioned relate to having multiple packages in the same directory,
//   this is not allowed in Go and so the test and source files have been separated into different package.
// - Test function was rewritten to more accurately test the New function,
//   namely its successful execution and its error cases.
