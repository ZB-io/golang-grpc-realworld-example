FUNCTION_DEF=func dsn() (string, error)
Based on the provided function `dsn()`, here are several test scenarios:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully Generate DSN String

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the dsn() function correctly generates a valid DSN string when all required environment variables are set.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set all required environment variables (DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, DB_PORT) with valid values.
  Act: Call the dsn() function.
  Assert: Check that the returned string matches the expected DSN format and that no error is returned.

Validation:
  The assertion should verify the exact format of the DSN string, including all components and the options string. This test is crucial as it ensures the core functionality of the function works as expected under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Missing DB_HOST Environment Variable

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles a missing DB_HOST environment variable.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set all required environment variables except DB_HOST.
  Act: Call the dsn() function.
  Assert: Verify that an error is returned with the message "$DB_HOST is not set" and that the returned DSN string is empty.

Validation:
  This test is important for error handling, ensuring the function fails gracefully and provides a clear error message when a critical piece of information is missing.

Scenario 3: Missing DB_USER Environment Variable

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles a missing DB_USER environment variable.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set all required environment variables except DB_USER.
  Act: Call the dsn() function.
  Assert: Verify that an error is returned with the message "$DB_USER is not set" and that the returned DSN string is empty.

Validation:
  Similar to Scenario 2, this test ensures proper error handling for another critical environment variable.

Scenario 4: Missing DB_PASSWORD Environment Variable

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles a missing DB_PASSWORD environment variable.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set all required environment variables except DB_PASSWORD.
  Act: Call the dsn() function.
  Assert: Verify that an error is returned with the message "$DB_PASSWORD is not set" and that the returned DSN string is empty.

Validation:
  This test continues the pattern of checking error handling for each required environment variable.

Scenario 5: Missing DB_NAME Environment Variable

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles a missing DB_NAME environment variable.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set all required environment variables except DB_NAME.
  Act: Call the dsn() function.
  Assert: Verify that an error is returned with the message "$DB_NAME is not set" and that the returned DSN string is empty.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the function properly validates the presence of the database name.

Scenario 6: Missing DB_PORT Environment Variable

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles a missing DB_PORT environment variable.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set all required environment variables except DB_PORT.
  Act: Call the dsn() function.
  Assert: Verify that an error is returned with the message "$DB_PORT is not set" and that the returned DSN string is empty.

Validation:
  This completes the set of tests for missing individual environment variables, ensuring comprehensive error checking.

Scenario 7: All Environment Variables Set to Empty Strings

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when all environment variables are set but contain empty strings.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set all required environment variables to empty strings.
  Act: Call the dsn() function.
  Assert: Verify that an error is returned (likely "$DB_HOST is not set") and that the returned DSN string is empty.

Validation:
  This edge case tests how the function handles technically set but effectively empty environment variables, which is important for robust error handling.

Scenario 8: Special Characters in Environment Variables

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles special characters in the environment variables, particularly in the password.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set all required environment variables, using a complex password with special characters.
  Act: Call the dsn() function.
  Assert: Check that the returned string correctly escapes or includes the special characters and that no error is returned.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle real-world scenarios where passwords or other fields might contain special characters, which is crucial for security and functionality in production environments.
```

These scenarios cover the main functionality, error cases, and some edge cases for the `dsn()` function. They test both the successful generation of the DSN string and various error conditions that might occur due to missing or invalid environment variables.
