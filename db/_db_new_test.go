FUNCTION_DEF=func New() (*gorm.DB, error)
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `New` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successful Database Connection

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the New function successfully establishes a connection to the database and returns a valid gorm.DB instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the database is accessible and the environment variables for the connection string are properly set.
  Act: Call the New() function.
  Assert: Check that the returned *gorm.DB is not nil and the error is nil.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it ensures the basic functionality of creating a database connection. It validates that the application can interact with the database, which is fundamental for most operations.

Scenario 2: Database Connection Retry

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly retries to connect to the database up to 10 times before giving up.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that fails to connect for the first few attempts but succeeds before the 10th try.
  Act: Call the New() function.
  Assert: Verify that a connection is established and the returned *gorm.DB is not nil, despite initial failures.
Validation:
  This test is important for ensuring the function's resilience in case of temporary network issues or database unavailability. It confirms that the retry mechanism works as intended.

Scenario 3: Database Connection Failure

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns an error when it fails to connect to the database after 10 attempts.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the environment to use invalid database credentials or an unreachable database.
  Act: Call the New() function.
  Assert: Check that the returned *gorm.DB is nil and the error is not nil.
Validation:
  This test is critical for error handling. It ensures that the function properly reports connection failures, allowing the application to handle such scenarios gracefully.

Scenario 4: Invalid DSN Configuration

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles and returns an error when the DSN (Data Source Name) is improperly configured.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the environment with invalid or missing DSN configuration.
  Act: Call the New() function.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a nil *gorm.DB and a non-nil error related to DSN configuration.
Validation:
  This test is important for catching configuration errors early. It ensures that the function fails fast when essential connection information is missing or incorrect.

Scenario 5: Connection Pool Configuration

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the database connection pool is correctly configured with the specified maximum idle connections.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock or real database connection.
  Act: Call the New() function.
  Assert: Check that the returned *gorm.DB has MaxIdleConns set to 3.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the connection pool is optimized as intended. Proper connection pool configuration is crucial for application performance and resource management.

Scenario 6: Logging Mode Configuration

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the logging mode for the database connection is correctly set to false.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call the New() function.
  Assert: Verify that the logging mode of the returned *gorm.DB is set to false.
Validation:
  This test is important for ensuring that the database operations are not unnecessarily verbose in production environments. It confirms that the logging configuration is applied as expected.

Scenario 7: Concurrent Access Safety

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the New function can be safely called concurrently without race conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test environment that supports concurrent execution.
  Act: Call the New() function multiple times concurrently using goroutines.
  Assert: Check that all calls return successfully without panics or data races.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for applications that might initialize database connections from multiple goroutines. It ensures thread-safety of the connection initialization process.
```

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `New` function, including successful operations, error handling, configuration validation, and concurrency safety. They aim to thoroughly test the function's behavior under different conditions and ensure its reliability in a production environment.
