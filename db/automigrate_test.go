Scenario 1: Successful AutoMigration of models

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the AutoMigrate function can successfully migrate models to the database without encountering an error.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock gorm.DB object with a successful response for AutoMigrate(&model.User{}, &model.Article{}, &model.Tag{}, &model.Comment{}) and no error.
    Act: Invoke the AutoMigrate function with the mock gorm.DB.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that no error is returned after the function execution.
Validation:
    The assertion of no error being returned validates the correctness of the function in normal operation. This is important as model migrations should occur without any errors for the application to run as expected.

Scenario 2: AutoMigration failure due to an error in one of the models

Details:
    Description: This test is intended to check if the AutoMigrate function correctly returns an error when a migration fails due to an error in one of the models.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock gorm.DB object with a failed response for AutoMigrate(&model.User{}, &model.Article{}, &model.Tag{}, &model.Comment{}) due to an error in one of the models.
    Act: Invoke the AutoMigrate function with the mock gorm.DB.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that an error is returned after the function execution.
Validation:
    The assertion that an error is returned validates the robustness of the function in handling and reporting migration errors. This is essential as errors in model migrations should be reported correctly for the application to handle them gracefully.

Scenario 3: AutoMigration with a null Database

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the AutoMigrate function correctly handles and returns an error when null Database is passed.
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a condition where the gorm.DB to be passed is null.
    Act: Invoke the AutoMigrate function with the null gorm.DB.
    Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error.
Validation:
    The assertion of an error being returned validates that the function can appropriately handle null inputs, preventing undefined behavior or potential crashes. Thorough null checking is important to ensure the robustness of an application.

Scenario 4: AutoMigration with an empty Database

Details:
    Description: This test is designed to validate how the function handles an empty Database.
Execution:
    Arrange: Setup a condition where the gorm.DB to be passed is empty.
    Act: Invoke the AutoMigrate function with the empty gorm.DB.
    Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to check the output of the function.
Validation:
    This assertion tests the robustness of the function against unexpected inputs. As empty database is not a needed scenario, AutoMigration function should handle this gracefully.
