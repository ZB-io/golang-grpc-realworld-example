Scenario 1: Normal Execution of the Function
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function executes successfully under normal conditions. Expected to load environment variables from the specified `.env` file and setup the database connection successfully.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the successful loading of environment variables and successful connections to the database.
    Act: Invoke the function `NewTestDB()`.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to confirm a `*gorm.DB` type is returned with the expected settings and without any errors.
  Validation:
    The choice of assertion depends on whether the database connection setup and environment loading return their expected results. This test is crucial for the basic understanding of the function behavior under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Error When Loading Environment Variables 
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the function behaves when there is an error loading the environment variables from the `.env` file.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Arrange for an error to occur when the `godotenv.Load("../env/test.env")` is called.
    Act: Invoke the function `NewTestDB()`.
    Assert: The function is expected to return an error message indicating an error occurred while loading the environment variables.
  Validation:
    We expect this error to occur since `godotenv.Load` couldn't find the `.env` file. This indeed is essential in testing how the function handles failure scenarios.

Scenario 3: Error When Opening the Database Connection
  Details:
    Description: This test checks how the function behaves when there's an error connecting to the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Cause the `gorm.Open` function to return an error. This could be arranged via a mock or by exposing a method to inject this error for testing purposes.
    Act: Invoke the `NewTestDB()`.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to confirm that an error is returned from the `NewTestDB()` function.
  Validation:
    The choice of assertion is dependent on whether the `gorm.Open` returns an error or not. This is important for testing how the function handles database connection errors, crucial for any application interacting with a database.

Scenario 4: Error When Opening the SQL Connection
  Details:
    Description: This test checks how the function behaves when there's an error connecting to the SQL database and it's important since Sql connection errors are common in an application.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Cause the `sql.Open` function to return an error.
    Act: Invoke the `NewTestDB()`.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to confirm that an error is returned from the `NewTestDB()` function.
  Validation:
    The choice of assertion is dependent on whether the `sql.Open` returns an error or not. This scenario tests the function's behavior during SQL database connection issues. This is crucial in any application that interacts with SQL databases.

Scenarios 5: Boosting Code Coverage by Testing Mutex Locks for txdbInitialization
  Details:
    Description: This test helps increase code coverage by handling the scenario where txdb has already been initialized.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set `txdbInitialized` to be `true` so that the mutex lock and unlocking part of the code can be bypassed.
    Act: Invoke the function `NewTestDB()`.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to confirm that `NewTestDB()` function does not re-initialize txdb.
  Validation:
    This assertion is required to cover all lines of the function, a basic necessity in testing for full code coverage. It also shows the importance of the function's ability to handle cases where txdb has already been initialized to avoid unnecessary reinitialization.
