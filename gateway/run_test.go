Scenario 1: Successful invocation of the run function

Details:
Description: 
This test is meant to check if the run function is successfully setting up the gateway server on port 3000 and also registering two endpoints called "UsersHandlerFromEndpoint" and "ArticlesHandlerFromEndpoint".

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the context, runtime.ServeMuxOption, runtime.NewServeMux, and grpc.DialOption. Also, mock gw.RegisterUsersHandlerFromEndpoint and gw.RegisterArticlesHandlerFromEndpoint to return nil (successful registration).
Act: Invoke the run function.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results from the invocation match the expected outcomes (i.e., success in setting up the gateway and endpoint registration).

Validation:
For this test, the assertions are made based on the expectation that the function behaves without raising any error under normal operation. The importance of this test lies in ensuring that the function is capable of starting up the gateway server on the expected port and registering the endpoints properly.

Scenario 2: Unsuccessful registration of UsersHandlerFromEndpoint

Details:
Description:
This test is designed to check how the run function handles situations where it fails to register the UsersHandlerFromEndpoint.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up the context, runtime.ServeMuxOption, runtime.NewServeMux, and grpc.DialOption. Also, mock gw.RegisterUsersHandlerFromEndpoint to return non-nil (error during registration).
Act: Invoke the run function.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results from the invocation match the expected outcomes (i.e., error return).

Validation:
The choice of assertion is guided by the function's expected error handling behavior when registration of the UsersHandlerFromEndpoint fails. This test is crucial for checking the function's resilience in the face of errors during endpoint registration.

Scenario 3: Unsuccessful registration of ArticlesHandlerFromEndpoint

Details:
Description:
The goal of this test is to assess the run function's response to unsuccessful registration of the ArticlesHandlerFromEndpoint.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up all required data as described in the other scenarios, but mock gw.RegisterArticlesHandlerFromEndpoint to return a non-nil response (indicating an error).
Act: Invoke the run function.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to certify that the actual results match the expected outcomes (an error return).

Validation:
The reason for this kind of assertion is to verify the function's robustness when it encounters errors while registering endpoints. By conducting this test, we can validate whether the function handles error situations while registering the ArticlesHandlerFromEndpoint.
