ROOST_METHOD_HASH=CheckPassword_377b31181b
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=CheckPassword_e6e0413d83

Scenario 1: Valid Password

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to validate the scenario when the correct password is supplied to the function. The function's task is to compare the hashed password of a user with a plain text password.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User struct with a hashed Password property. Determine the expected password to return a true statement.
  Act: Call the CheckPassword function on the created User instance and pass the correct password as an argument.
  Assert: Compare the returned result from the function with true.
Validation: 
  Assertion checks if the password check is successful when a correct password is provided. This is fundamental because in the real world scenario, users should be able to login with correct credentials.

Scenario 2: Invalid Password

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to validate the scenario when an incorrect password is supplied to the function. The function's task is to compare the hashed password of a user with a plain text password.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User struct with a hashed Password property. Determine a incorrect password which is expected to return a false statement.
  Act: Call the CheckPassword function on the created User instance and pass an incorrect password as an argument.
  Assert: Compare the returned result from the function with false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the password check fails when an incorrect password is provided. This is essential because applications shouldn't allow access to users with incorrect credentials.

Scenario 3: Empty Password

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function when an empty string is supplied as the password. The function should still properly compare the hashed password with the empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User struct with a hashed Password property.
  Act: Call the CheckPassword function with the empty string as an argument.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if an empty string as password is considered a wrong password. This is important because empty strings as passwords should not validate as true, which would lead to security vulnerabilities if that happened.

Scenario 4: Password Parameter as Null

Details:
  Description: Check the behavior of the function when the password parameter is null. If a null parameter is passed into the function, a panic might occur.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User struct with a hashed Password property.
  Act: Pass null as a parameter to the CheckPassword function.
  Assert: Verify that the error is handled gracefully and that an appropriate error response or action is returned.
Validation:
  Here, the importance of the test is to ensure the function can handle null inputs and fail gracefully. The function's behavior when it encounters a null input has a large impact on the reliability and robustness of the code.
