Scenario 1: Updating all fields within an Article

Details:
  Description: This test checks that all fields of an Article (Title, Description, and Body) can be successfully overwritten with new values. In a normal scenario, an Article author might want to update all parts of his/her article.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Article struct, setting up initial values for the Title, Description, and Body attributes.
  Act: Invoke the Overwrite function with the new parameters for Title, Description, and Body.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check whether each attribute in the Article struct contains the new values.
  
Validation:
  Assertion logic: The assertion checks for equality between the Article attributes which should each hold their new assigned value after function call.
  Importance: This normal operation test checks a core functionality that should always perform correctly for users to be able to edit their Articles.

Scenario 2:  Partial update on Article fields

Details:
  Description: This test scenario checks whether it's possible to updated only specific fields in an Article while leaving out others. For example, a user might not want to update the article body but just the title and description.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Article struct, setting up initial values for the Title, Description, and Body attributes.
  Act: Invoke the Overwrite function with new titles and descriptions but leaving out the body parameters.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check whether title and description have been updated while body remains as it was.
  
Validation:
  Assertion logic: The assertion checks against the expected values that should be found in an updated Article.
  Importance: The ability to selectively update Article fields is important for user flexibility. This test scenario verifies that an empty string for one of the parameters will not alter the corresponding field in the Article struct. 

Scenario 3: Updating article fields with empty strings

Details:
  Description: The test is meant to check whether an attempt to update the Article fields with empty strings does not change the initial values.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Article struct, setting up initial values for the Title, Description and Body attributes.
  Act: Invoke the Overwrite function with empty strings for all fields.
  Assert: Verify that the Article fields remain unchanged.
  
Validation:
  Assertion logic: The assertion checks that the initial Article fields match the output after the invocation of the Overwrite function. 
  Importance: User might accidentally attempt to update the Article with empty strings. This test is important to ensure such a scenario does not clear the initial Article details.
