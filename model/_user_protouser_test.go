FUNCTION_DEF=func (u *User) ProtoUser(token string) *pb.User
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `ProtoUser` method:

```
Scenario 1: Successful conversion of User to pb.User with valid token

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the ProtoUser method correctly converts a User struct to a pb.User struct, including a valid token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User struct with sample data and prepare a valid token string.
  Act: Call the ProtoUser method on the User instance, passing the token.
  Assert: Verify that the returned pb.User struct contains all the expected fields from the original User struct, plus the provided token.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the ProtoUser method correctly maps all relevant fields from the User struct to the pb.User struct. This is crucial for maintaining data consistency when communicating between different parts of the system using protocol buffers.

Scenario 2: Conversion of User to pb.User with empty fields

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of ProtoUser when the User struct has empty or zero-value fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User struct with minimal data (e.g., only Email and Username set, other fields empty).
  Act: Call the ProtoUser method with an empty token string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned pb.User struct contains the correct values for Email and Username, and empty strings for Bio and Image.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the ProtoUser method handles empty fields gracefully, which is common in real-world scenarios where users might not provide all optional information.

Scenario 3: Conversion of User to pb.User with maximum length values

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that ProtoUser correctly handles User structs with fields at their maximum allowed lengths.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User struct with all string fields set to their maximum allowed length (based on any validation rules in the system).
  Act: Call the ProtoUser method with a long but valid token.
  Assert: Verify that the returned pb.User struct contains all the fields exactly as they were in the original User struct, without truncation.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the ProtoUser method can handle edge cases with very long field values, which is important for maintaining data integrity and preventing unexpected truncation.

Scenario 4: Conversion of User to pb.User with special characters

Details:
  Description: This test checks if ProtoUser correctly handles User structs containing special characters in its fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User struct with fields containing special characters (e.g., Unicode characters, emojis, HTML tags).
  Act: Call the ProtoUser method with a token containing special characters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned pb.User struct contains all the fields exactly as they were in the original User struct, with special characters preserved.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring that the ProtoUser method correctly handles and preserves all types of characters, which is important for internationalization and preventing data corruption.

Scenario 5: Conversion of User to pb.User with null values

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of ProtoUser when dealing with null values in the User struct (if applicable).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User struct with some fields set to null (if the system allows it).
  Act: Call the ProtoUser method with a valid token.
  Assert: Verify that the returned pb.User struct handles null values appropriately (e.g., converting them to empty strings or default values).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the ProtoUser method gracefully handles potential null values, preventing nil pointer exceptions and maintaining consistent behavior across the system.

Scenario 6: Performance test for ProtoUser conversion

Details:
  Description: This test measures the performance of the ProtoUser method for a large number of conversions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a large slice of User structs (e.g., 10,000 entries).
  Act: Measure the time taken to convert all User structs to pb.User structs using ProtoUser.
  Assert: Verify that the conversion time is within acceptable limits (e.g., completes within a specific duration).
Validation:
  While not a functional test, this performance test is important to ensure that the ProtoUser method can handle bulk conversions efficiently, which is crucial for system scalability.
```

These test scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and potential issues that could arise when using the ProtoUser method. They aim to ensure the method's correctness, robustness, and performance across various situations.
